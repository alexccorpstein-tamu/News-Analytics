Changed to Python virtual environment for running things on Olympus
Realized Bertopic only supports python3.7 or greater so switched to Gensim
Gensim has a lot of the same functionality and has support for python 3.6.8 which is on the server
Working on gensim and Pandas test run with only 10 headlines to understand how both work runs so that I can then scale it up
