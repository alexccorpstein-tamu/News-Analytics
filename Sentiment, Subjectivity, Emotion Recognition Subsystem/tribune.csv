1,"M. Katherine Banks, Texas A&M’s incoming president, says she’s planning for a campus in “normal mode” this fall","Sign up for The Brief,When M. Katherine Banks became the new engineering school dean at Texas A&M University in 2012, an associate dean drove her to the Zachry building, the heart of the university’s engineering program in College Station.,He pulled into the basement-level garage and honked the horn twice — a preventive measure to scare off skunks that infested the aging facility.,Above them, the building reeked of mold. Engineering students not-so-lovingly dubbed it the “Zachry Smell.” Inside the building's lecture hall, a once-impressive revolving stage, was broken.,Ten years later, the skunks are gone. Banks raised $76 million in private donations that helped build a state-of-the-art engineering building that boasts multiple high-tech labs and collaborative meeting spaces.,She commissioned 10 original art pieces, all inspired by science, technology and engineering, for the half a million square foot building that now enrolls more than 21,000 students — nearly twice the number of students from when she started. Many leaders within Texas A&M point to the center as a physical testament to her success running the college, which now enrolls nearly a third of all of Texas A&M’s student body.,“The house that Banks built,” an assistant vice chancellor joked last week during a tour of the facility, causing Banks to cringe.,“I don’t know where that [phrase] came from,'' she said modestly.,Banks is not typically one to seek out attention, but starting June 1 she’ll enter the spotlight as the 26th president of Texas’ biggest university, the second woman to ever run the flagship campus.,She takes over as Texas A&M faces multiple challenges, including how to navigate a return to “normal” campus operations after the COVID-19 pandemic upended learning and campus life. She’ll also take the reins of a diversity and inclusion plan meant to increase students and faculty of color after a year where conversations about racial injustice and inequality on campus took center stage.,The Board of Regents last week approved her as the next president of Texas A&M, with a $925,000 annual salary over the next five years. Banks ended up negotiating her salary down $350,000 less than she was initially offered due to the current economic situation brought by the pandemic.,“If she can do for the rest of the university what she did for engineering, it's gonna be a hell of a show to watch” said System Chancellor John Sharp, who said he had tried to convince Banks to apply for president six years ago, but she wasn’t ready to leave the engineering school. “She's a visionary and an executor…[but] at the core of it all, it’s giving opportunities to the students that are here. I think that's what makes her tick.”,While Texas A&M leaders said Banks has the track record of a proven leader, in an interview with The Texas Tribune, Banks tread so cautiously she was reluctant to even outline her vision for the broader university or discuss goals she has as president.,She declined to weigh in on heated issues that she will certainly have to address in the coming year, like the debate over the Lawrence Sullivan Ross statue. She even stopped short of definitively choosing her favorite piece of art in the Zachry building during a tour.,“I believe it would be presumptive to outline a vision without first meeting with and listening to the many constituents and stakeholders about their challenges, opportunities and ideas,” Banks wrote in response to follow up questions.,Banks said she plans to embark on a listening tour across campus before making concrete plans or setting goals. She admits she has a learning curve ahead when it comes to running other aspects of campus, including student affairs and athletics.,But Banks is clear that she wants the fall semester at Texas A&M to be something of a return to pre-pandemic life.,“We're hopeful we will have a full [football] stadium ... we don't have to walk around with masks, we're hopeful we don't have social distancing,” Banks said “If we have an emergency situation, we will adjust to that. But right now, and perhaps this is the Aggie optimism, we are planning for a fully operational campus in normal mode.”,Banks said students learn best in the classroom interacting with faculty and other students.,“Without that, they may not...retain the information that we need them to be graduates of this institution,” she said.,But she cautioned it won’t be simply returning to college life as it was in 2019. She anticipates much of the fall will include rebuilding communities — social circles, faculty meetings, student organizations — that waned because they were difficult to maintain remotely.,Banks’ push for a totally in-person fall semester has the support of many students, but faculty are more cautious.,John Stallone, chair of the faculty senate, said while faculty understand the push to return to in-person classes, there is a concern that teaching in person will become a mandate.,“If we have another surge over the summer in COVID, then that's going to raise some concerns and some worries amongst faculty,” Stallone said. “I hope that the flexibility that we've had so far will remain as she takes over.”,Banks said she anticipates the future of higher education will include some kind of hybrid learning, with both remote and in-person instruction. Stallone cautions that often means extra work for faculty.,“You can't just use your in-person lecture online,” he said. “It's not just a direct transfer, or an easy transfer in that regard. So you have to do things a little bit differently in order for it to work well, simultaneously.”,Eric Mendoza, a junior who is student body president at Texas A&M, said he thinks a normal fall is also contingent on students getting vaccinated and he’s interested in seeing how the new leadership handles that ahead of the fall semester.,“I think the trickiest part ... is trying to convince our student body to want to get vaccinated,” Mendoza said, not because all students are hesitant to get the vaccine, but because they may be less concerned with getting seriously ill or not prioritizing finding an appointment.,Banks said she encourages everyone who can to get the vaccine, but declined to share an opinion of whether she believes vaccines should be required.,Recently, St. Edward's University, a small, private university in Austin, announced vaccines will be required for the fall semester. Elsewhere, Cornell University and Rutgers University are also among the few universities nationwide mandating the shots. This week, Gov. ,Last summer, intense protests broke out on campus over the statue of Sul Ross, a former Texas A&M president and Confederate general.,Banks would not share her personal opinions on the issue, saying Sharp’s decision to keep the statue was final and she supported the initiatives established to improve diversity among students and faculty. A task force was set up to provide recommendations to the university’s Academic Plaza, where the Ross statue is located, and tell “the full story of the university’s history.”,Asked about the university’s plans for diversity outreach, Banks said Texas A&M has done a good job of recruiting Hispanic students, but recognized the Black student population remained low. It currently hovers around 3%, though Black people are 12% of Texas’ overall population.,She stressed the university has a plan to address these disparities, pointing to the initiatives approved by the Board of Regents earlier this year which includes nearly $25 million dollars for additional scholarships to recruit more students of color and increased efforts to hire more faculty of color.,While Banks has increased student enrollment within the engineering school, it has not grown equally across all demographics. Black students still make up around 2.5% of all engineering students in fall 2020, ,Banks said recruiting Black students in engineering is a national challenge and educators need to start introducing students to a possible future in engineering early. She pointed to multiple programs she has launched to introduce K-12 students to engineering, curriculum help for science and math K-12 teachers, and additional programs for current Texas A&M students, including a summer bridge program to help underprepared students get up to speed.,Banks came to Texas A&M from Purdue University, where she headed the civil engineering school, and was a professor at Kansas State University before that.,She describes herself as a persistent leader who isn’t afraid to fail.,“I tell the students that often certainly you have to have a basic skill set, you have to work hard, but you have to be persistent,” she said. “So if you fail, then stand back up, dust yourself off and start again, figure out why you haven't done well and adjust. So I tend to have that characteristic. ... And if I want to do something, I'll do it.”,Indeed, many of the biggest wins and highest profile initiatives over the past few years at Texas A&M have Banks’ fingerprints on them.,She was instrumental in the university,She also oversaw the partnership with the Army Futures Command which has made the university’s RELLIS campus its hub for military research and new technology testing as it modernizes the Army, including cutting-edge research in hypersonics and autonomous vehicles.,As dean, Banks set a goal of enrolling 25,000 engineering students by 2025, ignoring skeptics who argued such an aggressive expansion would water down the program’s quality. The school is currently on track to meet that target and the program’s prestige is on the rise.,Just last week, U.S. News and World Report ranked the graduate engineering school 11th in the country and the best in the state for the first time, squeaking by the University of Texas at Austin.,She often refers back to her humble upbringing in Whitesburg, Kentucky as the place where she developed her values which have an emphasis on community and family. It’s also where she learned first hand how insurmountable it can be for young people to pick up and leave for a college education.,“We really didn't talk about [college],” Banks remembered. ”It certainly wasn't discussed in high school. ... We didn't really talk about moving away, we did not talk about, ‘What do you want to do when you grow up?’”,When she did pack up for Gainesville, Florida, where she earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Florida, her grandfather — whom she deeply respected and had a close relationship — was angry that she would leave.,Banks’ father graduated college, but she said the experience of disappointing her grandfather gave her perspective on how many first generation college students struggle with the prospect of leaving home.,It’s one reason why she set up engineering academies across the state where students are accepted to Texas A&M, but take their first two years at one of six partner community colleges. The students are taught by engineering professors at Texas A&M who Banks sends to the local colleges.,“Leaving an area that could be impoverished or a family [where a] student is a first-generation college student is quite daunting to think of, leaving their hometown, their surrounding area, their supportive community,” Banks said. “But if they have one or two years of community college, they develop a cohort [of students] and that cohort comes here together.”,Data shows students in the academies achieve slightly higher grade point averages than engineering students who start at the College Station campus.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, St. Edward's University, University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

2,"Texas A&M investigating ""large scale"" cheating case as universities see more academic misconduct in era of online classes","Need to stay updated on coronavirus news in Texas? Our evening roundup will help you stay on top of the day's latest updates. ,An already unusual fall semester was wrapping up when Texas A&M University officials sent out an email in early December to the hundreds of students in an online finance class that set off a panic.,Faculty reported concerns of cheating “on a very large scale” to the Aggie Honor System Office, after they noticed some students in the class answered online test questions too quickly. Later, faculty discovered entire exams posted on a “homework help” website that has become synonymous with cheating.,University officials told guilty students to self-report by 5 p.m. on Dec. 8. If they didn’t come forward but were found in violation of the academic honor code, they could face suspension or expulsion.,“If you engaged in this behavior, I would like to encourage you in the strongest way to reclaim your personal integrity,” said Timothy Powers, director of the Aggie Honor System Office, in the email to students.,University officials at Texas A&M and experts elsewhere said academic misconduct cases have increased during the pandemic as remote courses and online assignments create more opportunities for students to push the limits.,At Texas A&M, academic dishonesty reports have increased by as much as 20% from last fall, Powers said. The University of North Texas saw a 20% increase, and Texas State University saw reports of cheating increase by one-third over the previous fall. The University of Houston saw reports more than double from last fall to 456 cases as of Dec. 14.,“Instead of taking an assessment in class where the teacher is watching you, you are at your computer not being watched,” said Rachel Davenport, a lecturer at Texas State and vice chair of the Honor Code Council, which reviews academic misconduct cases. “The opportunity has just increased dramatically to use online sources.”,In the case at Texas A&M, students interviewed by The Texas Tribune said they used a website called Chegg to access answers on assignments. The website started years ago for textbook rentals and has since expanded to include online tutoring. For a monthly fee, students can submit questions that someone around the world will answer within a few hours. While critics said the site can be helpful for students seeking tutoring, they argue many students are misusing it to pass off another person’s work as their own.,According to Powers’ email, Texas A&M’s online learning platform, Canvas, tracks how long test questions are displayed on a student’s screen. He said there are “hundreds of examples” where students answered a question faster than it would take to read it.,Powers said in the email ”many, many” students in the finance class had already admitted to either posting questions online so someone else could answer them or searching for already answered questions to complete assignments and tests.,Complaints about the tutoring website from university administrators are widespread. This spring, ,In a statement, a Chegg spokesperson said they support academic integrity.,“At Chegg, we believe that expertise and experience is important to actually retain knowledge and apply it in whatever field students seek upon graduation, so we ask students to stick to our ,According to its honor code, Chegg prohibits cheating and will share user information and activity with universities if they suspect foul play.,Batiste would not say whether Texas A&M requested student activity regarding the finance class. Texas A&M would not discuss details of the investigation, including how many students self-reported the cheating. Neither of the two doctorate students who taught the class responded to a request for comment.,Earlier this fall, the,“Far from being a benign problem, contract cheating has implications for credibility of academic degrees, institutional accreditation and for society as a whole, as the students who engage in contract cheating graduate, enter the workforce, and move into leadership positions,” the statement said.,Texas A&M’s honor code reads: “An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.” The refrain is ingrained in students starting at freshman orientation.,Some students who self-reported cheating to the university said the stress of the ongoing pandemic and the shift to more virtual classes made it more difficult to find study partners or connect with professors in person for help. Those factors contributed to their decision to create an account on Chegg.,“The culmination of the pandemic and its effect on learning, the assignments being open-note and the ease of access to Chegg made the decision to use outside help a lot easier for most students,” a junior in the class told the Tribune via email. The student self-reported and asked not to be named because of fear of hurting his future job prospects.,The junior said he started using Chegg to help him with homework because he was struggling with the course material and the online format. Then, he saw exact questions from Chegg appear on a quiz.,“The moment I realized actual exam questions were on Chegg, I should've canceled my account,” he said.,While students were allowed to use their notes and textbook during quizzes and tests throughout the semester, it’s against policy to access and review test questions before an assessment.,In a letter submitted to the university as part of its investigation, a different unnamed student said professors should have provided more explicit communication about what is acceptable given that many of them were taking a variety of online, hybrid and in-person courses.,“Using the internet in an attempt to help a student figure out how to solve certain problems, not specifically to give them the answer, was a gray area throughout the course,” the student wrote. “When the professor did not ever talk about this gray area and did not monitor the suspicious activity from the beginning, this shaped the general understanding that students held as the course progressed.”,Academic integrity experts said providing proactive reminders about what is acceptable helps deter students from cheating. But, they said, common sense should dictate to students when their behavior is considered cheating.,“There’s a difference between students using online tools to prepare themselves and learn about things,” Powers said. “It’s completely different for a student to walk into an exam and have seen the identical questions with the identical multiple choice answers before. That should be different and... they should realize this is inappropriate.”,Even before the pandemic, online resources such as GroupMe, a group messaging app, were creating more opportunities for students to cheat. Last year, ,This fall, some professors at Texas Tech University in Lubbock also saw evidence of cheating through GroupMe, according to emails obtained by the Tribune. In November, the provost’s office recommended making final exams available 24 hours before they were due. But this past weekend, multiple professors shared with administrators that they disagreed with that recommendation, arguing it allows students to collaborate or use online help.,“Newsflash: Students ignore the ‘Strive for Honor” sermon,’” wrote journalism professor Lyombe Eko in an email to administrators and faculty, referring to Tech’s honor code.,Eko said he saw instances of cheating in his Media Law class. At least 25 students answered a question with an obscure incorrect answer not included in his lecture or the textbook.,“Minutes after a test or exam begins, some students post it and discuss it with their peers on GroupMe,” Eko wrote. “Some students wait for the answers there before they start to take the exam.”,Eko said a student alerted him of the GroupMe account. In the spring, he plans to explicitly tell students that sharing information on GroupMe counts as academic dishonesty.,Texas Tech administrators also suggested that faculty use an online proctoring tool called Proctorio, which prompts students to turn on their microphone and camera so professors can monitor them during an exam. But multiple professors said they felt Proctorio was an invasion of privacy. Students across the country ,Davenport said there are other ways professors can mitigate cheating. She advises professors to search for their questions online to see if they’ve been posted, to create a large bank of questions so students aren’t all taking identical tests and to provide flexibility with deadlines so students don’t feel pressured to cheat.,She said many students are more digitally savvy than their professors, especially those who never taught an online course before the pandemic. When courses shifted online rapidly in the spring, preventing cheating wasn’t a top priority.,“Many of them are learning, ‘what even is Chegg?’” she said. “They’re trying to catch up with so many other things that that kind of took a back seat.”,Chegg isn’t the only problem site out there. As soon as some professors get a handle on one website, a similar one pops up. Davenport said there’s even websites where students can pay someone to take their entire online class for them.,Two Aggie students who spoke to the Tribune and self-reported their misconduct received failing grades for the class and have been placed on academic probation until they complete an academic integrity program. They are also barred from graduating with honors.,Texas A&M administrators said that as of Dec. 14, no students had been suspended or expelled, but it could take as long as a month to navigate that process, not including winter break. Students can also appeal if they believe the punishment was too harsh.,One Aggie senior who said he self-reported and received an F in the class said he’s relieved he wasn’t expelled. He also asked not to be named for fear of repercussions for speaking out against the university. He thinks the university should reflect on the way the course is offered for future semesters.,“I'm not going to agree with what we did, but at the same time the way they handled it wasn’t entirely fair,” he said, arguing the professors should have caught this earlier if it was such a widespread issue. “I think they should really question the professors because of the fact that so many people did this in such a large class. There’s something questionable there.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, Texas Tech University, University of Texas at Austin and University of North Texas have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

At least 14 students from Ukraine have been identified as eligible for the financial support so far, Associate Vice Chancellor Tim Eaton said. The number is likely to increase as more students are identified, he said.,The move is part of the university’s response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this month, Texas A&M announced it would be ,“Our students from Ukraine are in a unique, sad and difficult position as their homeland is under attack, their family members are either fleeing to safety or fighting to save their country’s sovereignty,” Sharp said in a Tuesday memo to the university system’s presidents. “In many cases, our students from Ukraine will no longer have homes to return to, and their parents remain unable to work ... or worse.”,The funds for the new initiative will come from the university system’s ,“I am certain you will agree that the devastation our students and their family face qualifies them for this assistance,” Sharp said.,Sharp’s memo also said the university system will open its facilities to accommodate displaced Ukrainian professors and students so they can continue their work and research in Texas.,“The Texas A&M University System will not sit by and offer any support to Russia, as Putin continues his illegal and immoral attack on Ukraine and its people,” Sharp said.,We can’t wait to welcome you in person and online to the 2022 ,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and the Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

4,"Texas A&M announces more online offerings, classroom capacity caps and daily cleaning schedules for fall return","With universities and colleges ,In a letter to the A&M community, Carol Fierke, provost and executive vice president, said the university was working to “maximize” the number of classes with at least one face-to-face meeting with an instructor each week and that almost half of its classes would be available through an in-person format. But safely hosting students for the fall semester will lead to a series of adjustments.,All in-person classes will be available remotely to students who do not return to campus in the fall — a change that has prompted a widespread installation of cameras, microphones and other equipment to bring classrooms online.,A&M will limit its course schedule to weekdays, and more classes will be scheduled for later in the day. This comes after Texas A&M officials floated the possibility of holding Saturday classes to spread students out.,Students who do return to campus in the fall will be provided 30-minute “passing periods” in between classes to space out foot traffic, and the school plans to implement classroom cleaning periods at noon each day. In her letter, Fierke said this could lead to the rescheduling of some courses, but she indicated the university is still planning out those changes. To maintain social distancing, classrooms will be limited to 33% to 40% capacity.,The changes come after university officials were forced to scramble to transition to remote learning midway through the spring semester after the new coronavirus reached Texas. The guidelines echo some of those announced by the University of Texas at Austin, where classroom capacity will also be limited, courses will be spread out to reduce the number of students on campus and many courses will be offered exclusively online.,Texas A&M previously announced that classes would begin three days earlier and that final exams would be moved online after the Thanksgiving break. Students, faculty and staff will be required to wear face masks in campus buildings. A&M officials also previously indicated residence halls would reopen, with students expected to maintain social distancing as much as possible and with designated spaces in residence halls for students to use as they quarantine themselves.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

5,Lucrative Los Alamos National Lab contract awarded to team that includes Texas A&M,"The Texas A&M University System is part of an alliance that was awarded a lucrative contract to manage and operate Los Alamos National Laboratory, the birthplace of the U.S. atomic bomb.,The U.S. Department of Energy, headed by A&M alumnus and former Texas Gov. ,The University of Texas System also bid for the contract, which is worth an estimated $2.5 billion a year and can be extended for five one-year increments following the five-year base period. The New Mexico lab's current management contract expires at the end of September but will be adjusted to allow for a four-month transition period, according to the Energy Department's ,“We are committed to building on the legacy of world-class research, unparalleled innovation, and service to public good that have been the hallmark of the laboratory since it was founded in 1943,” A&M System Chancellor John Sharp said in a statement. He said Triad couldn't provide additional information until the transition begins.,A prominent federal lab facility that employees more than 11,000, Los Alamos is overseen by the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration and houses radioactive and weapons-grade nuclear materials.

6,Federal judge throws out hiring discrimination lawsuit against Texas A&M,"Sign up for The Brief,A federal judge ,In a decision published Friday, U.S. District Judge Charles Eskridge said that the passage of Senate Bill 17 — which bans public universities in Texas from considering race or other characteristics beyond merit in hiring — renders the lawsuit brought by Richard Lowery, a white finance professor at the University of Texas at Austin, moot and no longer ripe for a claim.,“In light of substantial change in applicable law, further factual development is plainly required before the scope of injunctive relief —if any — would be fit for judicial review,” the judge wrote. “A challenge to those practices will only be appropriate, if ever, after SB 17 actually takes effect. To that extent, this action is unripe.”,Lowery has not applied to a position at Texas A&M and, according to the lawsuit, “refuses to do so until his application will be considered on what he perceives to be an equal basis.” He said he believed he could be a strong candidate if he were to apply for a job with the university; however, the judge ruled that Lowery cannot assume ongoing discrimination exists if he is not a candidate for a position.,“Otherwise, any putative plaintiff could sue a potential employer without ever applying, simply upon allegation the posited discriminatory practices deterred application,” Eskridge wrote.,Lowery is represented by America First Legal — a group created by Stephen Miller, a policy adviser for former President Donald Trump, and Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general for Texas and the legal architect of the state’s six-week abortion ban.,Neither Lowery nor Mitchell responded to a request for comment Friday. The Texas A&M System sent a press release announcing the court’s decision, but a system spokesperson said the system did not have a comment on the ruling itself.,Lowery filed the lawsuit in 2022 against the Texas A&M University System and its board of regents, as well as some specific administrators at the Texas A&M flagship. In that suit, he claimed that a new fellowship program announced in the summer of 2022 called the Accountability, Climate, Equity and Scholarship Faculty Fellows Program, violates Title VI and Title IX of the federal Civil Rights Act as well as the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause.,While the ACES program focuses on hiring recently graduated doctoral students who want to enter academia, the separate ACES Plus Program focuses on “mid-career and senior tenure-track hires from underrepresented minority groups, that contribute to moving the structural composition of our faculty towards parity with that of the State of Texas.” It sets aside $2 million over the next two fiscal years to help match a fellow’s base salary and benefits, up to a maximum of $100,000.,According to Texas A&M’s announcement of the new fellowship program in July 2022, the university identified underrepresented groups as African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians.,Lowery’s lawsuit also accused Texas A&M of setting aside faculty positions specifically for “underrepresented” racial groups. It points to an August 2022 email sent by an unnamed business professor to the head of the recruiting committee for the department of finance, Shane A. Johnson.,“I heard from someone that one of our lines is reserved for an ‘underrepresented minority.’ Is that correct?” the professor’s email read, according to a copy included as an exhibit in the lawsuit. Johnson replied later that day, “The underrepresented line would potentially be a third position, so yes reserved, but not one of our ‘regular’ positions.”,Earlier this year, Lowery dismissed the claim against the system and filed an amended complaint just against the university, its former president and other administrators. In February, the university filed another motion to dismiss.,Then, in May, the U.S. Supreme Court held that race-conscious admissions at public universities were illegal. Around that time, state lawmakers also passed a law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion offices at public universities and prohibits a university from giving preferential treatment to job candidates based on race, sex color, ethnicity or national origin.,In June, Eskridge requested both Texas A&M and Lowery submit supplemental arguments as to why the case should move forward given the legal developments.,Texas A&M argued that SB 17 already requires the university to change any hiring practices that provide now-unlawful preferences to different groups of people and submitted a memo from the university’s ethics and compliance officer indicating the school has begun to comply with the law.,A Texas A&M spokesperson told The Texas Tribune that the ACES program will be phased out after the 2024-25 academic year and the ACES Plus Program is currently on pause.,Lowery submitted additional evidence to try and prove his claims, including online announcements made by the interim president at Texas A&M regarding the implementation of SB 17. But the judge said these additional submissions did not change the fact that the case is now moot.,“There is certainly time and place enough for Lowery to bring further action if Texas A&M continues what he believes to be unconstitutional hiring practices,” the judge stated. “And nothing here should be construed to preclude later action on future facts.”,America First Legal also represents,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University System and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

7,Texas A&M President Katherine Banks resigns amid fallout from failed hiring of journalism professor,"Sign up for The Brief,After a week of turmoil over the botched hiring of a Black journalist to revive the Texas A&M University journalism department, M. Katherine Banks has resigned as the university’s president.,Mark A. Welsh III, dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service, will serve as acting president until the Board of Regents can meet to name an interim president. Texas A&M System Chancellor John Sharp has recommended they appoint Welsh as an interim until the board can do a national search for a new president. Banks’ resignation is effective immediately. She will receive no severance from the university.,In a letter sent to A&M System Chancellor John Sharp Thursday evening, Banks wrote, “The recent challenges regarding Dr. [Kathleen] McElroy have made it clear to me that I must retire immediately. The negative press is a distraction from the wonderful work being done here.”,The fallout over McElroy’s hiring, which has garnered national media attention, marks the culmination of Banks’ two-year tenure, which was often met with pushback from faculty and students who consistently raised concerns with the direction she was taking the university and the way in which her administration was communicating its vision.,During that time, faculty leaders have passed resolutions calling for more involvement in university decisions, and research leaders on campus raised concerns with her administration’s decision-making. She was forced to walk back the decision to abruptly end the print publication of the university’s student newspaper, The Battalion, after students and alumni protested. Her administration also faced pushback from students after the school decided to cut funding and sponsorship of an annual campus drag show, known as Draggieland. Throughout all of that, Sharp has remained supportive of Banks’ leadership.,In response to the news, McElroy told the Tribune in a text message Friday evening: ""I’m deeply grateful for the groundswell of support I’ve received, especially from Aggies of all majors, and my former and current students. There’s much more I could say and will say about what has unfolded. But for now, I’ll reserve those statements for a future date."",The latest fracas on campus that led to Banks’ resignation comes after the university’s faculty senate passed a resolution Wednesday to create a fact-finding committee into the mishandling of the hiring of McElroy. During that meeting, Banks took responsibility for the flawed hiring process but told faculty members that she did not approve changes to an offer letter that led a prospective journalism professor to walk away from negotiations amid conservative backlash to her hiring.,However, Hart Blanton, the head of the university's department of communications and journalism who was closely involved in McElroy's recruiting, said in a statement Friday that Banks interfered with the hiring process early on and that ,The university system's office of general counsel has begun an investigation into the failed hiring, said Laylan Copelin, vice chancellor of marketing and communication. The probe will include reviews of all events, communications and documents as well as interviews with key university officials like Banks and Blanton.,""We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened and why, learn from the mistakes and do better in the future,"" Copelin said in a statement.,McElroy, an experienced journalism professor currently working at the University of Texas at Austin who previously worked as an editor at The New York Times, turned down an offer to reboot A&M’s journalism program after a ,“This offer letter ... really makes it clear that they don’t want me there,” McElroy said last week about the one-year contract. “But in no shape, form or fashion would I give up a tenured position at UT for a one-year contract that emphasizes that you can be let go at any point.”,Initially, Texas A&M celebrated hiring McElroy with a public signing ceremony to announce her hiring. But in the weeks following, vocal groups from outside the university system expressed issues with her previous employment at The New York Times and her support for diversity in newsrooms. McElroy has said she was told that not everyone was pleased by her joining the faculty. Critics of her hiring focused on her prior work on diversity and inclusion.,McElroy said she was further told by José Luis Bermúdez, then interim dean of Texas A&M’s College of Arts and Sciences, that there was “noise in the [university] system” about her, though he did not give specifics. When she pressed him, she said he told her, “you’re a Black woman who worked at The New York Times.” He told her that in some conservative circles, The New York Times is akin to Pravda, the newspaper of the Communist Party in Russia that began in the early 1900s.,McElroy said that Bermúdez ultimately told her he could not protect her from university leaders facing pressure to fire her over “DEI hysteria” surrounding her appointment and advised McElroy to stay in her tenured role at UT-Austin.,Earlier this week, ,One group that voiced concern to the administration about McElroy’s selection was The Rudder Association, a conservative alumni group that has previously ,In response to Banks' resignation Friday, The Rudder Association Matt Poling said: ""We join with others in appreciation of her now nearly 12 years of dedicated service to Texas A&M including the last two as president of our great university."",Faculty raised concerns this week about the role of outside influences in the university's hiring practices. During a meeting with the faculty senate Wednesday, Banks said she hasn't met with The Rudder Association since her term as president started two years ago, and Vice President of Faculty Affairs N.K. Anand said no outside groups contacted him or his office regarding McElroy's hiring.,On Thursday evening, Sharp said in a letter to faculty that he shared their concerns about outside influences on hiring and promotion practices. He said he plays no role in hiring processes except for three top positions: the university's president and the vice chancellors of agriculture and engineering.,""Outside influence is never welcome, nor invited. It also is frustrating when outside groups try to take credit for some action, sowing doubt and discord among the Aggie family,"" Sharp wrote. ""Other than [those three positions], I don't believe it is my place to be a part of the hiring process for faculty."",McElroy’s hiring and decision to stay at UT-Austin came as universities across the state are dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion offices after the state passed a law banning them this year.,In the days following the Tribune’s reporting, faculty leaders ,Tracy Hammond, speaker for the Texas A&M Faculty Senate, wrote in a letter addressed to both Banks and Sharp that the group’s executive committee “decries the appearance of outside influence in the hiring and promotion of faculty.”,This is not the first time faculty have raised concerns with Banks since she became president two years ago after spending a decade as the vice chancellor and Dean of Engineering at Texas A&M.,Upon her appointment, she immediately hired MGT Consulting to review A&M’s organizational structure and provide recommendations for change. In December 2021, she announced 41 recommendations that she had accepted and implemented throughout her first year.,The recommendations include combining A&M’s College of Liberal Arts, College of Science and College of Geosciences into the College of Arts and Sciences; launching a new School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts to house performance studies, dance and visualization programs under one roof; and reviving the journalism department.,Other changes were met with more pushback. She restructured the university’s libraries so they no longer house tenured faculty, forcing tenured librarians to switch to another academic department in order to keep their tenure or lose it entirely. New hires will not be eligible for tenure moving forward.,Banks also approved a restructuring of the Qatar campus, a branch of Texas A&M in the Middle East that offers engineering undergraduate and graduate degrees.,Qatar faculty who work in areas beyond engineering will no longer be able to conduct research. Faculty who teach in areas that can grant degrees will shift from rolling contracts to fixed-term contracts for up to five years, and faculty who teach in nondegree-granting areas will be on annual contracts, which critics argue will create more job insecurity. Finally, Banks consolidated school leadership under one dean.,Critics have argued that changing the faculty contract process will make it more difficult to recruit quality professors, and many will leave Qatar.,Earlier this year, Banks drew criticism from researchers on campus after the Council of Principal Investigators, an elected group of faculty and researchers who help oversee research activity at the school, conducted a survey that found “widespread discontent,” according to responses from “principal investigators” — faculty and researchers within the A&M system who are allowed to oversee research grants.,Overall, the poll found that these principal investigators do not trust the current administration, and many feel that administrators are cultivating an environment of fear and intimidation on campus. In the survey responses, research faculty lamented that the university has made too many interim appointments and “unqualified leadership appointments” rather than conducting national searches to fill open positions, which has led to “incompetent handling of issues.” They also felt the administration was “insincere” about their efforts to have faculty involved in long-term planning and decision-making.,The council decided to organize the poll in December 2022 after a well-respected chemist at Texas A&M, Karen Wooley, wrote a letter to Banks warning that many of the changes she had made since starting as president were “causing substantial disruptions and threatening the integrity of this prestigious and precious institution.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, Kat,Join us for conversations that matter with newly announced speakers at the ",21-Jul-23,Texas Tribune,0,0,sadness
8,Texas A&M suspended professor accused of criticizing Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick in lecture,"Sign up for The Brief,Joy Alonzo, a respected opioid expert, was in a panic.,The Texas A&M University professor had just returned home from giving a routine lecture on the opioid crisis at the University of Texas Medical Branch in March when she learned a student had accused her of disparaging Lt. Gov. ,In the few hours it took to drive from Galveston, the complaint had made its way to her supervisors, and Alonzo’s job was suddenly at risk.,“I am in a ton of trouble. Please call me!” she wrote to Chandler Self, the UTMB professor who invited her to speak.,Alonzo was right to be afraid. Not only were her supervisors involved, but so was Chancellor John Sharp, a former state comptroller who now holds the highest-ranking position in the Texas A&M University System, which includes 11 public universities and 153,000 students. And Sharp was communicating directly with the lieutenant governor’s office about the incident, promising swift action.,Less than two hours after the lecture ended, Patrick’s chief of staff had sent Sharp a link to Alonzo’s professional bio.,Shortly after, Sharp sent a text directly to the lieutenant governor: “Joy Alonzo has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation re firing her. shud [sic] be finished by end of week.”,The text message was signed “jsharp.”,For free speech advocates, health experts and students, Texas A&M’s investigation of Alonzo was a shocking demonstration of how quickly university leaders allow politicians to interfere in classroom discussions on topics in which they are not experts — and another example of increasing political involvement from state leaders in how Texas universities are managed.,The revelation comes as Texas A&M is reeling over concerns that the university allowed politically motivated outsiders to derail the hiring of ,In an email obtained by The Texas Tribune through a public records request, Alonzo told Self the investigation had been kicked off by a student “who has ties to Texas A&M Leadership.”,The Texas A&M system confirmed the series of phone calls and text messages that led to Alonzo’s investigation was kicked off by Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham, a graduate of UTMB’s medical school. The Tribune confirmed her daughter, a first-year medical student at the time, attended Alonzo’s lecture. Buckingham served six years in the Texas Senate with Patrick, who endorsed her run for land commissioner last year, and she recently attended Sharp’s wedding in May.,Buckingham declined to comment. One day after this story published, however, Buckingham tweeted a response that did not address the Tribune’s questions but encouraged “leaders in academia, the media, and elected office” to “focus on meaningful policy solutions, not destructive blame games.”,A few hours after Texas A&M started looking into the complaint, course leaders at UTMB sent an email to students in the class saying Alonzo’s comments “about Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and his role in the opioid crisis” did not represent the opinion of the university.,The email also included a “formal censure” of Alonzo, although it did not specify what she said that was offensive.,Neither UTMB nor Texas A&M would confirm what Alonzo said that prompted such a reaction, and UTMB students interviewed by the Tribune recalled a vague reference to Patrick’s office but nothing specific.,UTMB declined to comment for this story, and Alonzo declined to be interviewed.,Ultimately Texas A&M allowed Alonzo to keep her job after an internal investigation could not confirm any wrongdoing.,In a statement, Texas A&M University System spokesperson Laylan Copelin said Sharp’s text to Patrick was a “typical update,” saying it is not unusual for the chancellor to “keep elected officials informed when something at Texas A&M might interest them.”,“It is not unusual to respond to any state official who has concerns about anything occurring at the Texas A&M System,” said Copelin, who said the system followed standard procedure to look into the claim.,Patrick did not respond to a request for comment.,Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit legal group focused on protecting free speech on college campuses, said “it would be highly inappropriate for a university to conduct an investigation if a faculty member says something critical of a state leader or a government official.”,“That is, I think, a misuse of institutional resources, and it’s one that will have a chilling effect and that has a chilling effect even if you wind up clearing the professor,” Steinbaugh said.,A day after the complaint about Alonzo’s talk, Marcia Ory, a professor at Texas A&M Health and co-chair of the university’s Opioid Task Force with Alonzo, warned about the long-term consequences.,“The incident in Galveston yesterday is probably an indicator of how sensitive and politically charged this topic is and the need to tread lightly and be aware that anything can be taken out of context,” Ory wrote in an email to Jon Mogford, vice president of Texas A&M Health.,“It’s a shame because all we want is to make people aware of harm-reduction strategies that can save lives, especially among youth and young adults who are especially vulnerable these days,” wrote Ory, who did not respond to a request for comment.,Alonzo has spent more than two decades as a pharmacist in Japan, Missouri and elsewhere, and has taught college students in Texas for more than a decade. She now teaches at Texas A&M while working as an ambulatory care pharmacy director at a free health clinic in Bryan.,She has helped bring millions of federal research dollars to the university, and last year Texas A&M’s pharmacy school ,One of Alonzo’s recent projects focuses on training people to use Narcan, a nasal spray that reverses opioid effects and can save lives in overdose cases. She’s also advised state leaders on other public policies that could improve the fight against opioid overdoses.,Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid often illegally manufactured by Mexican drug cartels, is a growing problem. Between 2019 and 2021, overdose deaths involving fentanyl in the state rose nearly 400%.,This year, Gov. ,Lawmakers allocated ,But instead of backing other recommended strategies to reduce overdose deaths, such as legalizing test strips that can detect the presence of fentanyl in other drugs, lawmakers focused on a more ,Public health experts like Alonzo have largely supported harm-reduction efforts rather than increasing punishments for drug users. As the crisis intensified, Alonzo often received urgent emails from Texas school districts and law enforcement agencies eager for training and naloxone kits. In the past, she estimated she had given away ,Self, the professor at UTMB, scheduled Alonzo to give the lecture to the first-year medical students months in advance.,“I can’t tell you enough how much the students value this presentation,” Self wrote in October, according to emails obtained through an open records request. “I get feedback all the time from them telling me how important they view this talk. They’ll come up to me even months later to tell me.”,On March 7, the two started the day with breakfast at the laid-back Mosquito Cafe in Galveston before heading to the lecture, which was mandatory for students to attend.,The lecture was not recorded, but according to presentation slides obtained by the Tribune through an open records request, Alonzo gave students a broad overview of the opioid crisis and the science behind opioids. She walked them through how to prevent opioid deaths, how to recognize an overdose and how to administer naloxone. She even touched on what to do if a police dog was exposed to fentanyl.,The slides show that Alonzo discussed how a lack of infrastructure limits the state’s ability to respond to the crisis, noting that many Texas counties lack a medical examiner; reporting on opioid deaths by emergency rooms is infrequent; and many law enforcement agencies and local health departments don’t track opioid deaths.,This means the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers Texas a nonreporter when it comes to opioid data, which makes it more difficult for researchers to receive grants to tackle the issue. (Alonzo gave her presentation before the Legislature passed new reporting laws this year.),The lecture ended around noon. Afterward, students gathered at the front of the class to grab free naloxone kits provided by Alonzo. Some stuck around to ask Alonzo questions.,The course’s instructors gave no indication anything had gone awry.,Alonzo got in her car and started her two-and-a-half-hour journey home.,At 4:22 p.m., as Alonzo was learning that a controversy was brewing, a course coordinator sent an email to the entire class distancing UTMB from comments Alonzo allegedly made about Patrick. The subject line read, “STATEMENT OF FORMAL CENSURE.”,“The statements made by the guest lecturer do not represent the opinion or position of the University of Texas Medical Branch, nor are they considered as core curriculum content for this course,” the email said.,“UTMB does not support or condone these comments. We take these matters very seriously and wish to express our disapproval of the comment and apologize for harm it may have caused for members of our community,” the email continued. “We hereby issue a formal censure of these statements and will take steps to ensure that such behavior does not happen in the future.”,The email did not specify what comments had led to the censure.,The trouble had started several hours earlier when Buckingham called Patrick to alert him that an A&M professor had made negative comments about him during a guest lecture at UTMB, said Copelin, the A&M system spokesperson. Buckingham then called Jenny Jones, the university system’s vice chancellor for governmental relations.,Copelin said a text message had alerted Buckingham of the comments, but he did not provide information on who sent the text message.,Patrick then called Sharp and Kevin Eltife, the chair of the University of Texas System’s board, Copelin said. The call between Sharp and Patrick was short. Patrick’s chief of staff, Darrell Davila, followed with the text to Sharp that linked to Alonzo’s faculty page. Eltife declined to comment.,Sharp had a staff member look into the complaint and that staff member asked then-A&M President M. Katherine Banks' office to investigate.,Copelin said Sharp’s request went through the chain of command at A&M’s Health Science Center and ended up with Kevin McGinnis, the system’s vice president and chief compliance officer.,At the same time, the government relations team alerted the Health Science Center and the pharmacy school, which are affiliated with Alonzo, Copelin said.,A&M officials received a copy of UTMB’s censure statement and reached out for more information, but UTMB did not cooperate, Copelin said.,“By the close of the day, McGinnis decided to put Alonzo on paid leave and investigate to determine what really happened,” Copelin said in a statement.,As the situation developed, A&M officials updated Patrick and his team.,At 4:43 p.m., just 15 minutes after UTMB sent its official censure letter, Jones alerted Patrick’s deputy chief of staff, Marian Wallace, that the investigation was underway.,“joy alonzo placed on administrative leave pending firing investigation this week js,” read the message from Jones obtained by the Tribune through a public records request.,Copelin said the university’s handling of the complaint against Alonzo followed standard procedure and appropriately updated the relevant lawmakers on the investigation’s progress.,“The investigation into the matter was a reasonable step to take, particularly after UTMB issued a public statement ‘censuring’ one of our faculty members,” he said. “In fact, it would have been irresponsible not to look into it.”,Texas A&M would not answer questions about what specific policy Alonzo may have violated with her comments or provide documents pertaining to the investigation, citing state law that allows a university to withhold such information if a person is cleared of wrongdoing.,The timing of the complaint came as the legislative session was heating up. Universities, including Texas A&M, were making pitches to lawmakers to devote some of the state’s multibillion-dollar surplus to fund special projects.,Alonzo’s predicament also comes as Texas universities are dealing with increasing government involvement in ostensibly independent public universities, particularly at the hand of Patrick, whom Alonzo was accused of criticizing. This year, Texas lawmakers banned diversity, equity and inclusion offices on college campuses, a priority for Patrick. These offices target underrepresented groups on campus to help them succeed, but critics accused them of pushing “woke,” left-leaning ideology on students and faculty.,Patrick also prioritized a bill that would limit certain conversations about race and gender in college classrooms. When professors at UT-Austin publicly reaffirmed their academic freedom to teach critical race theory last year, Patrick pledged to ban tenure in public universities. Ultimately, that proposal was unsuccessful, but faculty say the broad attack on higher education has made Texas a less appealing and more difficult place to work.,When students at UTMB received the email hours after the lecture, several started texting each other, trying to figure out what Alonzo had said that was so offensive.,According to one student who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from the school, some students wondered if it was when Alonzo said that the lieutenant governor’s office was one of the reasons it’s hard for drug users to access certain care for opioid addiction or overdoses.,A second student who also asked to remain anonymous for the same reason said Alonzo made a comment that the lieutenant governor’s office had opposed policies that could have prevented opioid-related deaths, and by doing so had allowed people to die.,A third student who also spoke on the condition of anonymity said Alonzo talked about how policies, like the state’s ban on fentanyl test strips, have a direct impact on the ability to prevent opioid overdoses and deaths. A push to legalize the test strips died earlier this year in the Patrick-led Senate ,All of the students interviewed said they felt Alonzo’s comments were accurate and they were not offended by anything in the presentation.,In a statement provided by Copelin, the A&M system spokesperson, Alonzo said “her remarks were mischaracterized and taken out of context,” but she did not confirm exactly what the comments were.,“She added that she had no issue with how the university handled the situation,” Copelin said.,The third student at UTMB said the email from the school was frustrating because it was unclear which comments the university found problematic.,“We’ve been left wondering exactly what it was they objected to,” the student said. “That vagueness just leads to some more self-censorship, since it’s hard to tell what is and isn’t allowed.”,Steinbaugh, an attorney with the legal nonprofit FIRE, said schools have the right to criticize an employee or guest speaker for statements they make, but issuing a formal censure sends a strong and unambiguous message.,“That is a suggestion that if you repeat this language or these criticisms, then you will be subject to disciplinary consequences that go beyond formal censure,” he said. “That is a way to really put an exclamation point on the chilling effect.”,In a statement last week to faculty who were upset about the fallout over the botched hiring of McElroy to the journalism department, Sharp expressed concern about outside influences in the hiring and promotion of faculty, saying it was “never welcome, nor invited.”,Sharp said he only participates in hiring questions over the school’s president and vice chancellors for agriculture and engineering.,“Other than that, I don’t believe it is my place to be part of the hiring process for faculty,” he wrote.,A few hours after Alonzo reached out to Self about the trouble she was in, she finally heard back. But the tone of the email was notably different from the earlier cordial exchanges.,Self said she did not record the lecture and noted that “all further correspondence will be funneled through our Office of Education.”,Self referred a request for comment by the Tribune to UTMB’s media relations department, which declined to discuss the situation.,Meanwhile, emails obtained through an open records request show that opioid experts and advocates across the state started sending Alonzo letters of support that evening.,“I’ve never seen her to be anything other than professional, knowledgeable, and compassionate,” wrote Kathy Posey, who helped start the ,Lucas Hill, a clinical associate professor of pharmacy at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote in his letter that Alonzo was not a divisive educator.,“While I was not present during her guest lecture at the University of Texas Medical Branch this morning, my interactions with Dr. Alonzo gives me great confidence that she engages learners in discussions of controversial topics with the professionalism and restraint described in established principles of academic freedom,” he wrote.,The stakes are high for professors who simultaneously work in their fields and teach, many of whom, like Alonzo, do not have tenure. And it raises concerns that medical experts working on high-stakes issues like the opioid crisis might withhold important, life-saving information out of fear of reprimand or punishment.,“When we’re dealing with basic life-saving interventions, chilling effects can have much more deep consequences,” said Aaron Ferguson, an addiction treatment expert in Austin who works with researchers at public universities to combat opioid overdoses. “People don't feel emboldened to share basic science that could save people’s lives.”,On March 21, two weeks after she was placed on paid leave, Alonzo received an email saying her leave had been lifted.,The following day, pharmacy school Dean George Udeani said in a memo to Alonzo that during the lecture she “related an anecdote and an interaction with a state official.”,“I understand that your comment did not assign blame. However, some members of the audience felt that your anecdote was offensive,” he wrote.,“While it is important to preserve and defend academic freedom and as such be able to discuss and present to students and the public the results of research observations and strategies, you should be mindful of how you present your views,” Udeani said.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University System, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas System and Kathleen McElroy have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

9,"Texas A&M officials say moving Sul Ross statue is no longer an option, but students say the university never made that clear","Sign up for The Brief,Texas A&M leadership is clearing the air: the much-disputed Lawrence Sullivan Ross statue, honoring the former university president and Confederate general, is staying put.,Interim President John Junkins stressed the school’s intentions to The Texas Tribune on Wednesday, just two days after the university ,Junkins said the statue will remain where it is at the center of campus, known as Academic Plaza.,“I hope the communication I put out today hopefully clears up any ambiguity,” Junkins told the Tribune, acknowledging that he should have been clearer about the university’s stance on the statue when the board of regents met earlier this week to discuss diversity initiatives.,On Monday, the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents ,University officials said Wednesday that the decision to keep the Ross statue in place is not a new one, and that the diversity committee that has been studying the issue for the past three months was never considering removing the statue. Indeed, in August, System Chancellor John Sharp cited an attorney general opinion that said removing the statue would require an act of the Legislature.,But at least one student who served on the committee said he was unaware that moving the statue was off the table. He called it “disheartening” when he was told by a Tribune reporter Wednesday.,“You can’t say that you appreciate the report and, [say] ‘Yes, we do we have things we need to discuss,’ and in the same breath say ‘It’s not going anywhere,’” said Matthew Francis Jr., a junior who served on the commission as a representative of the TAMU chapter of the NAACP. “What's the point in progress if those who have the power to make progress are just going to continue to double down on the very thing that we're trying to make progress on?”,The report released Monday framed the future of the Ross statue as an undecided issue. It said current students think a final decision needs to be made on the Ross statue by university leaders, and strife and division would continue and damage the university’s reputation if left unaddressed. The committee looked at 19 other universities dealing with similar debates to remove statues, symbols or names on campus.,“These findings show that based on case study trends, if Texas A&M decides against removal of the Ross statue, there is a very likely chance that protests and controversy surrounding it will continue,” the report said, noting that there are questions about whether legislative approval is required to move or remove the statue.,The debate over the Sul Ross statue has persisted for years. But after a summer of protests across the nation demanding racial justice, some TAMU students again began calling for the removal of the monument.,Junkins, who became interim president on Jan. 1, said he was not told prior to assuming the role that the statue would remain in its current position, and that he had not studied the issue until the last month. He did not elaborate as to how the decision to keep the statue came to pass.,His predecessor, Michael Young, ,“This group will be asked to begin with making a recommendation on the Lawrence Sullivan Ross statue in the near future,” ,When the diversity, equity and inclusion committee was formally announced a month later, the 45-member committee was tasked with “findings” with no mention of the Sul Ross statue. Young set an Oct. 30 deadline for the report, which was published three months late.,Qynetta Caston, a senior and director of the Black Student Alliance Council who has advocated for the statue’s removal, said Wednesday she was also unaware a decision had been made to keep the statue in its place. She said the university has not been transparent with its intentions, adding that the diversity committee led them to believe that the statue’s removal was still a possibility.,“I’m really curious as to why they haven’t told the community their decision on the Sullivan Ross statue,” she said.,The new task force has until March 26 to provide university leadership with possible designs for a new Academic Plaza.,Disclosure: Texas A&M ","Jan. 27, 2021",Texas Tribune,0,0,surprise

The impeachment trial was conducted in executive session. Kraus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,The controversy began when a student senator revealed that ,Kraus apologized to senators privately.,“As family is incredibly important to me, I just wanted to try and protect my brother and see what was best for him to occur,” Kraus wrote in an apology letter published by The Battalion. “Unfortunately, I made inaccurate decisions that were not indicative of my character in trying to defend a member of my family.”,But the Battalion reported that senators wanted a public apology.,Initially, Kraus filed an appeal to the Judicial Court of Texas A&M. According to The Battalion, the request is made if someone believes there was an error in student government procedures. The court of student justices granted an injunction, which paused the proceedings while a judicial trial was conducted.,Shortly after, Kraus withdrew the appeal, according to a statement he released on Sept. 19 defending his actions, stating that he had the authority to adjust the cabinet position qualifications as president.,“I apologized for not proactively communicating my revision of the qualifications when it was read aloud at the general senate meeting and requested an intermediary action as an alternative to impeachment,” Kraus wrote, adding that impeachment should be used only when someone misused their office.,“An impeachment would overturn the desires of the Texas A&M student body, who elected me to represent them as Student Body President,” he stated.,According to The Battalion, senators declined to comment on the vote, citing a gag order, until the senate’s Internal Affairs Committee makes an official statement.,The last time members of the Texas A&M student government brought impeachment proceedings against a student body president was in 2014.,That impeachment was ,The impeachment ultimately failed.,Many state leaders have served as student body presidents in college, including Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp.,Paxton was also student body president when he attended Baylor University.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

12,West Texas A&M will no longer require students to pay for textbooks starting next fall,"Sign up for The Brief,West Texas A&M University will no longer require students to buy textbooks starting next fall, President Walter Wendler said in a letter to students, faculty and staff last week.,In his letter Thursday, Wendler said the move is an effort to reduce the cost of earning a bachelor's degree, which has skyrocketed nationwide in recent years. It also presents an opportunity for faculty to explore how artificial intelligence can be used as a teaching aid, he said.,The decision comes as all public universities in the state agreed to hold undergraduate tuition and fees flat for the next two years in exchange for additional funding from state lawmakers this past legislative session.,The purchase of reference books and digital materials like style guides may still be required for courses, but Wendler said many virtual options are available to replace them as well.,The university, located in the small West Texas city of Canyon about 100 miles outside Lubbock, will also provide additional free printing to the nearly 9, 300 students who wish to have a physical copy of course materials, Wendler said. Students’ allotment of free pages to print will be increased from 1,500 to 3,000, though students may be able to print more pages if they need them, he said.,The announcement comes nearly five years after Wendler first floated the idea to do away with textbook costs in his ,It also comes a few months after the university's faculty,Faculty's no-confidence resolution in April mentioned Wendler's push to make West Texas A&M ""the first 'textbook-free' campus in Texas"" as one of their concerns, arguing that his focus on making college more affordable has ""disproportionately focused on relatively small expenses, such as textbook costs, rather than more significant impacts on tuition and student fees."",They also argued that the ""textbook-free"" campus goal infringes on faculty's academic freedom to select the materials they believe are best suited for their courses and ""undervalues faculty's intellectual property"" by forcing them to create open-access materials rather than developing or revising materials with traditional publishers.,The average college textbook in the U.S. is estimated to cost $105.37, and in-state undergraduates at four-year universities pay $1,226 in average a year for required books and supplies, according to the ,Wendler acknowledged the transition might be challenging but he said he is hopeful West Texas A&M will be able to eliminate textbook costs by next year’s fall semester. The university will offer more than a dozen workshops this semester to teach faculty and staff how they can use artificial intelligence and other digital tools when developing course materials.,Wendler also acknowledged some of the potential pitfalls of using AI, which may draw from incorrect or fabricated information when generating materials. But he said faculty should be able to get the job done without much effort.,“I just fiddled around with an economics textbook … and got rough outlines for each chapter,” he said. “I showed it to someone, and they said, ‘Well, this hits the high points.’”,Students applauded last week's decision but professors expressed concerns about the impact it might have on their ability to prepare their classes.,Wendler’s message came less than 48 hours before West Texas A&M’s Faculty Senate had its first meeting this semester. Faculty Senate President David Craig, who learned about the initiative in a meeting with Wendler on Thursday morning, said the announcement took the Faculty Senate by surprise, made members feel excluded from the decision and left many things unclear.,Wendler’s letter “says that the various colleges will provide the funding in case a textbook is required, but there's no more detail about how that would be done or whether [there] would be any other funds,” Craig said.,Craig, an associate professor of physics, said the change may put more pressure on professors, who will now have to find teaching materials that are free of charge. The task may prove impossible in some cases as free resources are not always available, especially for courses that may require students to earn a certificate or accreditation, he added.,“There are a host of issues involving faculty load [and] faculty compensation,” he said. “There's not much detail in the memo about how funding will be allocated other than that the individual college divisions or colleges will have to provide the funding for the textbooks in the cases where the textbooks are required. It's a very new initiative, and it raises a whole host of concerns that we're gonna have to address.”,Wendler said several professors have expressed their support.,“We have hundreds of excellent faculty who assured me that they want to do everything they can to help reduce costs to students,” he said. “Our mission with this particular initiative is to help reduce the costs of higher education to students, because so many are concerned about what these costs are.”,West Texas A&M Student Body President Filiberto Avila said he is excited about the change and expects it to move the university forward. Avila, who is also a member of the Student Senate’s Academic Affairs Committee, said he and his fellow students have pushed for the measure in the past.,Avila, a senior digital and communications media senior, estimates he has spent between $80-$120 on required textbooks every semester.,“A lot of my professors in the past, and currently, tend to also utilize [free-to-use] materials or materials where students don't have to pay,” he said. “I think a lot of professors are already doing this. I think with this new announcement, it'll increase that from other professors as well.”,Removing the cost of textbooks is a step in the right direction to make college more affordable, said Kimberly Clarida, a higher education policy analyst at the left-leaning think tank Every Texan.,“Oftentimes, there are low-income and first-generation college students who have to wait several weeks to purchase the books because they are either waiting for financial aid or trying to work to save up enough money in order to purchase books for the courses each semester,” she said. “That puts them behind academically and it just adds an additional level of stress.”,Clarida said she is hopeful no-cost textbooks will become a trend across other universities in the coming years, but is wary that the Texas Legislature may do something to prevent that.,“People want to make money,” she said. “There's no telling what may pop up, but I would love to envision a world where students aren't having to take on these additional costs or unnecessary costs that the university could easily provide or take care of for students.”,Kate McGee contributed to this story. ,Disclosure: Every Texan, Texas A&M University and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

13,Brazos County won’t restore Texas A&M early-voting location despite students’ pushback,"Sign up for The Brief,The Brazos County Commissioners Court has decided to take no action on bringing back the on-campus early-voting location at Texas A&M University for the 2022 elections, despite admitting that they made a mistake in removing the site at last week’s meeting.,At Tuesday’s meeting, commissioners heard from College Station and Bryan officials who expressed that they support having early voting at the Memorial Student Center — but not for this year. They said it would be logistically difficult to accommodate a change back to the on-campus site now because the cities have already prepared notices and materials for College Station City Hall as the early voting location. Tanya Smith, College Station’s city secretary, added that the change would cost additional money that the city hasn’t budgeted for.,“Rushing causes mistakes,” Smith said. “Let’s wait until the next election year.”,Commissioners Irma Cauley and Nancy Berry said at the meeting they are in favor of bringing the student center site back for 2023. When reached by The Texas Tribune on Monday evening, Berry had said she would support reinstating it for 2022 if it’s logistically possible.,Commissioner Steve Aldrich, who had requested that the discussion about reinstating the student center location for this year be put on Tuesday’s agenda, did not attend the meeting in protest of the tax rate vote. Commissioner Russ Ford, who had stated at last week’s meeting that he supports reopening the site for 2022, also was not present for the same reason.,The no-action vote passed without much debate amongst the present commissioners, and audience members were not allowed to provide input.,“You’re disenfranchising thousands of campus community members,” said a person in the crowd.,This vote is the latest update in A&M students’ monthslong fight against the county’s removal of the early-voting site — a decision students say would suppress the youth vote.,“Whether they realize it or not, it is voter suppression,” said Kristina Samuel, a senior and president of ,Commissioners voted 4-1 on July 5 to move the early-voting location for Precinct 3 — in which the university is located — from the campus to City Hall, though there will still be a polling location at the MSC on Election Day. Berry, who oversees the precinct, cited complaints from nonstudent voters about difficulties navigating the campus and low turnout at the MSC as reasons for the change. The Texas Tribune has requested data for early-voting turnout in recent elections, but did not receive the information by late Monday.,Student pushback to the decision on early voting was initially tepid because many students were away for the summer, though Democratic Party Chair Amy Alge and Republican Party Chair Elianor Vessali did ,In meeting after meeting at the Commissioners Court, students testified that the MSC’s central location allows them not only to more easily vote between classes but also help others become aware of the elections in the first place. The off-campus site, however, would require many to squeeze a 30-minute walk each way into their already busy schedule. And for those who drive, they would have to sit in traffic and navigate a parking lot that is smaller than what is available to them at the MSC. A ,“We just know that this is going to de-incentivize students a lot, and voter turnout will be lower if we don’t do something about it,” Samuel said.,Texas A&M in College Station, the largest university in Texas, has ,This fight for students’ voting access is not rare. This year, Bexar County initially planned to limit early-voting locations before facing pushback from students and other community members. The county has since added ,The fight is also not new. In 2018, students at Prairie View A&M — a historically Black university that has a ,Another ,“It’s a sense of Groundhog Day because we’ve been here before with trying to protect the student vote via campus polling locations, and then a sense of Whac-A-Mole because we’ve yet to see a set of policies that would protect them long term,” said Alex Birnel, advocacy director of MOVE Texas.,In response to the backlash at A&M this year, some Brazos County commissioners initially wanted to reopen MSC as the second early-voting location for Precinct 3. But a misinterpretation of the state’s election code — as Aldrich ,County officials also repeatedly told advocates ,“I’m in favor of going back to the MSC for ’23, and I’m sorry that I made the mistake when I did and I apologize,” Berry said at the Sept. 20 meeting. “But I think we need to move forward.”,Other commissioners, however, raised concerns about how they have been misinformed throughout the process.,“We heard testimony that we can change it this year and then we heard other testimony that we can’t change this year, so again we’ve got misinformation,” said Ford, who was the sole vote against the change in July, said in the same September meeting.,Ahead of Tuesday’s meeting to reconsider the MSC early-voting location, Birnel said MOVE Texas and other voting rights organizations are keeping litigation in their toolkit, but he would much more prefer building relationships with local and state governments to engage the youth vote.,“We’d love to see counties create the kind of infrastructure that makes democracy possible and also as a public good,” he said.,Similarly, Samuel said her organization has been looking into possible legal actions, but she noted that the chapter is also “not waiting until the last minute to find an alternate method” like a bus that could transport students directly from MSC to City Hall. And even without the current challenge to reopen the MSC, Samuel said she knew this election cycle would be significant because it is the first major one following the ,“It’s definitely made this a lot more emotionally heightened and definitely energized us,” Samuel said. “There’s a lot at stake here.”,Disclosure: MOVE Texas, Texas A&M University and The New York Times have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

15,"Texas A&M recruited a UT professor to revive its journalism program, then backtracked after “DEI hysteria”","Sign up for The Brief,When Texas A&M University announced last month that it had hired a director to revive its journalism school, it included the kind of fanfare usually reserved for college coaches and athletes.,The university set up maroon, silver and white balloons around a table outside its Academic Building for an official signing ceremony. It was there that Kathleen O. McElroy, a respected journalist with a long career, officially accepted the position to run the new program and teach as a tenured professor, pending approval from the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents.,McElroy, a 1981 Texas A&M graduate, was the director of the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism between 2018 and 2022, where she is a tenured professor. Earlier, she spent 20 years in various editing roles at The New York Times until heading to UT-Austin to pursue her doctorate.,She has studied news media and race, with a focus on how to improve diversity and inclusion within newsrooms, and spent her career covering other areas like sports and obituaries. Her master's thesis focused on the obituaries of civil rights leaders. Now, she was excited to head back to her alma mater to build a brand new program there.,But in the last several weeks, McElroy told The Texas Tribune, the deal with Texas A&M fell apart.,In the days after the signing ceremony, she said, A&M employees told her an increasingly vocal network of constituents within the system were expressing issues with her experience at the Times and with her work on race and diversity in newsrooms, McElroy said.,Behind the scenes, A&M spent weeks altering the terms of her job. After hearing about the concerns, McElroy agreed to a five-year contract position without tenure, which would have avoided a review by regents. On Sunday, she received a third offer, this time with a one-year contract and emphasizing that the appointment was at will and that she could be terminated at any time. She has rejected the offer and shared all of the offer letters with the Tribune.,The situation comes at a fraught time at Texas public universities. Schools are preparing for ,Conservative Texans — from locally elected public school trustees to top state officials — have labeled several books and schools of thought that center the perspectives of people of color as “woke” ideologies that make white children feel guilty for the country’s history of racism. Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court ,McElroy said she was told that her appointment was caught up in “DEI hysteria” as Texas university leaders try to figure out what type of work involving race is allowed.,“I feel damaged by this entire process,” said McElroy, who is a Black woman and a native of Houston’s Third Ward, and whose father, ,A Texas A&M University spokesperson did not immediately respond to a list of emailed questions about the issue.,On Friday, McElroy said, she got a call from A&M’s interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, José Luis Bermúdez, warning her that there were people who could force leadership to fire her and he could not protect her.,The call came one day after the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents met and discussed personnel matters in executive session, ,According to McElroy, Bermúdez told her that her hiring had “stirred up a hornet’s nest,” that there were people against her and that, “even if he hired me, these people could make him fire me … that the president and the chancellor, no one can stop that from happening,” she said.,Ultimately, he advised her to stay in her tenured role at UT-Austin.,On Sunday, she received the latest iteration of an offer letter, which was different from the one she publicly signed on campus. Texas A&M was now offering her a one-year contract as a professor without tenure, and a three-year appointment as the director of the journalism program, though it noted that she could be fired at any time, she said.,“This offer letter on Sunday really makes it clear that they don’t want me there,” she said. “But in no shape, form or fashion would I give up a tenured position at UT for a one-year contract that emphasizes that you can be let go at any point.”,Weeks after the public celebration about the new A&M position, she has rescinded her resignation at UT and will stay in Austin, according to an email sent to that school’s journalism department Tuesday morning and obtained by the Tribune.,In a statement, Bermúdez said Texas A&M policy does not allow him to comment on personnel deliberations.,“However, we can confirm that Dr. McElroy has an offer in hand and that we have not been notified her plans have changed — we hope that’s not the case. We certainly regret any misunderstanding that may have taken place,” he said in a statement.,When Banks announced that the university would bring back its journalism program in 2021, it was an exciting moment for many students, faculty and alumni.,Texas A&M had dropped its journalism program in 2004 after 55 years, though it continued to offer it as a minor and then as a liberal arts degree.,The Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, which oversees the university, approved the new major in February. It is still waiting for final approval from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.,McElroy said the university started to woo her last summer, at first as a consultant as it relaunched the program and then to possibly run it.,According to the original offer letter that she signed during the June 13 ceremony, McElroy was hired as a tenured professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism and as the journalism program’s director, without an end date to her appointment. Still, the Texas A&M University System Board of Regents, whose members are appointed by the governor, would have to approve her tenure position.,McElroy’s responsibilities had little to do specifically with diversity or equity, she said. She was hired to help build a curriculum that specifically addresses delivering news to underserved audiences across the state, as well as growing the program, hiring faculty and helping expand its internship program for future student journalists.,That’s the kind of work that McElroy is known for, journalism experts said.,“She’s always constantly trying to improve opportunities for journalism students so they can enter the career and continue building out great storytelling,” said Judy Oskam, director of the School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Texas State University. “That’s what I always think of when I think of Kathleen.”,When A&M suggested that it announce McElroy’s hiring with a signing day, McElroy said she didn’t want the attention.,“But I was willing to go along with it because if A&M wanted to celebrate journalism, then I want to be a part of that,” she said.,The signing ceremony got a huge positive response on social media, according to an email sent to McElroy by the university’s social media coordinator.,“This is one of the most positively received stories we have shared during my time at [marketing and communications],” wrote Jacob Alan Svetz, a social media coordinator at Texas A&M, in an email to McElroy. “Of the hundreds of posts congratulating Texas A&M, Arts and Sciences, and Kathleen, I saw two negative posts — pretty unheard-of levels of positivity for today’s internet.”,But within days, the conservative website Texas Scorecard ,That website is the reporting arm of Empower Texans, a Tea Party-aligned group formed with millions in oil money that holds considerable influence over Texas officials. Empower Texans and its affiliated groups blur the lines between newsroom, lobbying firm and political action committee. It has aimed to upend Texas politics with pricey primary challenges to replace moderate Republicans with hard-line conservatives.,In a statement, Texas A&M defended McElroy to Texas Scorecard, calling her a “superb professor, veteran journalist and proven leader.”,“She has worked for newsrooms for 30 years, and has led journalism programs at two Tier 1 research institutions,” the university told Texas Scorecard. “Her track record of building a successful curriculum — coupled with her deep understanding of the media landscape — positions her uniquely to lead the new program.”,But McElroy said she had a conversation with Bermúdez, the interim arts and sciences dean, on June 19 that struck a different tone.,According to written notes McElroy took during the calls and provided to the Tribune, Bermúdez said he wanted her to “go into this with eyes open” and that Texas A&M is different from UT-Austin in terms of its politics and culture. McElroy said she was told that she had a big target on her back.,Bermúdez said there were concerns about McElroy going through the tenure process, which requires the approval of the board of regents.,McElroy said that Bermúdez told her that “it might be wise to consider all the ways the wheels might come off.” In that conversation, McElroy said they alluded to what happened to journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones when the University of North Carolina’s board of trustees ,Ultimately, McElroy said, Bermúdez convinced her not to go for tenure. Instead, she agreed to be a professor of practice with a five-year contract.,A few days later, they had another conversation in which Bermúdez suggested McElroy give a presentation to the board of regents at its August meeting about her vision for the program, she said.,McElroy was further told there was “noise in the [university] system” about her, though he did not give specifics.,On June 26, McElroy met with Bermúdez and Susan Ballabina, chief external affairs officer and senior vice president for academic and strategic collaborations, to walk through the presentation to the board of regents in August. She was told to see the presentation as an opportunity to tell the regents who she is and how she fits within Aggie core values.,McElroy said she left that conversation feeling positive.,“I’m gonna wow them, I’m looking forward to this and I’m hoping I can even get money from these folks,” she remembered thinking.,But then she got a call from Bermúdez on Friday afternoon that quickly erased those good feelings when he told her people outside the university could force the school to find a new director and no one could stop it.,On Sunday, the new offer came in for a one-year contract to teach and a three-year appointment as director.,Ultimately, McElroy said she was surprised by the backlash. She said as reality set in during these talks, she remarked that she was so disappointed that not much had changed about the culture at Texas A&M since she was a student in the ’70s and ’80s. She said the university insisted it was different. It was better.,“Well, it doesn’t feel that way,” she said.,Disclosure: Kathleen McElroy, Texas A&M University, The New York Times, the Texas A&M University System and the University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

16,Texas A&M faculty leaders say President Kathy Banks is leaving them out of major decisions,"Sign up for The Brief,Faculty leaders at Texas A&M University in College Station are calling on President Kathy Banks to better collaborate and be more transparent with professors about changes to the university., ,Just weeks before the start of the new academic year, the Faculty Senate , ,“This is a matter of sentiment,” said Kathryn Falvo, a senator and history professor from Texas A&M Galveston, , ,The vote, which is largely symbolic, signaled an escalation in tension among faculty members who are frustrated with Banks’ leadership of the 73,000-student university. The faculty has expressed openness to taking additional measures if the relationship doesn’t change. Meanwhile, the university argues it has included faculty in many changes made throughout Banks’ first year., ,Banks was dean of Texas A&M’s engineering school before she , ,The resolution argues that Banks did not seek enough faculty input before approving those changes, which has created distrust among faculty in the administration’s decision-making process., ,“[S]ustainable and lasting change at a major university comes not via presidential decree, but rather by developing collective buy-in for new ideas from its constituent groups,” the resolution states. It also calls for Banks to recommit to the academic principle of shared governance., ,Shared governance is the longstanding academic principle held at universities across the country that a university’s internal operations are run through collaboration of the governing board, administration and faculty. It is a principle adopted by multiple national organizations that guide universities across the country, including the Association of American Universities and the American Association of University Professors., ,The resolution was approved by 80% of the 77 faculty senators who were present at the Zoom meeting and who voted on the measure, according to Dale Rice, faculty senate president., ,While faculty had expressed concerns with various changes discussed throughout the spring semester, the resolution signals that they could become a more collectively outspoken group in opposition to Banks’ leadership moving forward., ,At least one faculty senator said at the meeting that if the status quo continues, it could lead to a vote of no confidence., ,“I want President Banks to succeed, but if things keep going the way they’re going, things could go that way,” said Adam Kolasinski, a finance professor and senator. “I see this resolution as a way to try to avoid that outcome.”, ,The recommendations Banks has started to put in place include combining A&M’s College of Liberal Arts, College of Science and College of Geosciences into one College of Arts and Sciences. It is also launching a new School of Performance, Visualization & Fine Arts to house performance studies, dance and visualization programs under one roof. These changes, among others, will go into effect Sept. 1, , ,In a statement, the university pushed back on the notion that faculty have not been involved in changes under Banks’ tenure., ,“It’s disappointing that this resolution doesn’t recognize the extensive faculty input that has been listened to on every major issue and change that has occurred in the last year,” said N.K. Anand, vice president for faculty affairs. “There have been multiple opportunities for faculty opinion to influence decisions. There simply is not a single example given of when both the spirit and the letter of the policy was not followed.”, ,But Rice, president of the Faculty Senate, said there is a difference between alerting faculty of upcoming changes and having “meaningful” shared governance., ,“You have to invite faculty into the process early on, and that has not happened in many situations,” he said. “And you also either need to take into account faculty concerns or give a full explanation of why decisions are being made that don’t take those concerns into account. You can argue all day long that we have followed the rules to the letter, but that doesn’t mean that meaningful shared governance occurred.”, ,Other changes include a restructuring of the university’s libraries so they no longer house tenured faculty. Tenured librarians will be able to keep their tenure if they switched to another academic department within the university. New hires will not be eligible for tenure moving forward, according to university spokesperson Kelly Brown., ,Banks also approved a restructuring of the Qatar campus, a branch of Texas A&M in the Middle East that offers engineering undergraduate and graduate degrees., ,According to a July 14 memo sent to the Qatar community, as of Sept. 1, faculty who work in areas beyond engineering will no longer be able to conduct research. Faculty who teach in areas that can grant degrees will shift from rolling contracts to fixed-term contracts for up to five years, and faculty who teach in non-degree granting areas will be on annual contracts, which critics argue will create more job insecurity., ,Critics have argued that changing the faculty contract process will make it more difficult to recruit quality professors, and many will leave Qatar., ,Beyond the 41 reorganization recommendations, Banks has made other changes over the past year that have received pushback from faculty and students., ,In February, Banks announced the student newspaper, The Battalion, , ,Joe Ramirez, vice president of student affairs, issued an apology for the way the changes were announced. The school ultimately added Battalion representatives to the working group that is discussing ideas for how to implement another one of Banks’ recommendations: reviving a journalism school at Texas A&M., ,Banks and administrators also faced criticism for pulling funding and support for an annual drag show on campus called Dragglieland.

17,Texas A&M students protest after president ends print publication of 129-year-old Battalion newspaper,"Sign up for The Brief,A day after Texas A&M University administrators notified employees that the school’s 129-year-old student newspaper, The Battalion, was to cease printing weekly editions immediately, President M. Katherine Banks said she will allow the paper to print through the end of the semester.,The Battalion, which is also available online, will continue as a digital-only publication.,The modified plan about the print publication came amid public outcry after The Battalion reported it would be ending the weekly paper edition immediately, per Banks’ order.,But in a statement issued late Friday, Banks modified her decision, allowing the newspaper to continue its weekly print schedule for this semester.,In that statement, Banks elaborated on the decision, saying that eliminating the print version would be in line with a more digitally focused journalism department, which she plans to resurrect.,“Times have changed and we want The Battalion and others interested in journalism as a profession to be at the forefront when they graduate,” Banks said in a statement issued Friday afternoon.,Myranda Campanella, the paper’s editor-in-chief, said while she’s excited the staff has until the end of the semester, the change of plans does not address the future of the newspaper.,“We’re still going to look into the merits of the administration being able to stop us from printing at all, but now we have a little more time before they want to implement that,” she said.,The news that the university was ending The Battalion’s print edition broke late Thursday after ,Banks met with Campanella on Friday. It was then that Banks told her she wants the student newspaper to move entirely to a digital format and be placed within Texas A&M’s new journalism department, which has yet to open.,The university did not immediately make Banks available for an interview.,No details were provided to The Battalion’s student,“I just feel really demoralized,” Campanella said. “People look forward to this paper every week. This is out of nowhere.”,In 2003, Texas A&M dismantled its journalism department. Since that time, students interested in journalism at Texas A&M could pursue it as a minor or through independent study. Late last year, discussion began about bringing back ,Banks’ timing, and the lack of discussion, are puzzling to at least one student media expert.,“If the students and adviser of The Battalion had gotten together and didn’t want to have a print edition and said it would be better to run digitally, I think everyone would be fine with that,” said Chris Whitley, president of the College Media Association and director of student publications at Tarrant County College. “What’s making people upset is because this is taken out of their hands, this is a choice made by the university president on her own.”,Whitley, a Texas A&M graduate and former Battalion editor-in-chief, said this kind of overreach has a chilling effect.,​”If any university president dictates this kind of control, I don’t see how it doesn’t send a message that ‘you better not mess with us,’” Whitley said.,According to Pils, a majority of the newspaper’s annual profit comes from print advertising. Campanella and Pils said The Battalion has simultaneously published online since 1997.,​​”We have a huge following online, on Twitter, on Facebook,” Campanella said. “We get our content online, and we still publish online the day that we publish print. Every story that is in the print goes online. So it’s not like our audiences are ever missing out.”,Campanella, who met with Banks on Friday, said she was told that shifting the publication online does not mean the university is trying to control content or that the decision was made because of any specific article or coverage.,“Everything sounds so confusing that it’s a little fishy,” Campanella said. “​​It just doesn’t make any sense. … There seems like a wider issue that they’re not telling us. I asked her who made this decision with her, and she just kept saying ‘university leadership.’”,When Banks took the helm last spring, she commissioned a consulting company to review the university’s organizational structure and make recommendations. The report included some major changes, including merging the college of liberal arts with the college of sciences and college of geosciences. It also suggested moving political science students and international studies students into the Bush School of Government and Public Service.,It also suggested that Texas A&M create a new journalism department.,A working group established to determine what a journalism department might look like met for the first time Wednesday, but at least one person in attendance said there was no discussion about the newspaper’s future.,“We were all blindsided,” said Angelique Gammon, a journalism instructor at the university. “No one seemed to know that this was going to come. There was the problem that we knew of. We were all shocked.”,Gammon said she was reassured that Banks will allow the paper to continue printing through the end of the semester, but she said questions remain about the paper’s independence now and in the future.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

18,"Texas A&M and University of Texas systems expect to reopen in the fall, and A&M says it will play football","Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional comment.,The most visible public universities in Texas are moving toward reopening their campuses in the fall — and two say they plan to play football when they do.,On Thursday, Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp told all 11 university presidents in the system that they will reopen their campuses next school year and be ready to play sports, a university system official confirmed to The Texas Tribune. Texas Tech University has also announced that it plans to resume on-campus classes in the fall, and university President Lawrence Schovanec told the Tribune that Tech is planning to play sports, too, though it's unlikely either school will be able to bring back sports like football on its own.,Meanwhile, University of Texas System Chancellor James B. Milliken told the Tribune during a live event Thursday that ""it's pretty clear we will be open in the fall."",""Not entirely like last fall, but not like this spring, either,"" he said.,Unlike his counterpart at A&M, Milliken didn't make a declaration about football.,""Sports are maybe the only thing above the chancellor's pay grade,"" he said.,All Texas universities are closed for in-person classes due to the threat of the new coronavirus. Gov. ,Baylor University and Texas Woman's University have already announced that they will resume on-campus classes in the fall. [Update: The Texas State University System said Friday that it, too, will ,In an interview with The Texas Tribune on Thursday evening, Abbott said he is talking with the university systems ""at multiple levels"" and spoke Wednesday with Sharp. They did not speak in detail about reopening, but it did come up, Abbott said.,""More importantly, this is being conducted more broadly with the Higher Education Coordinating Board,"" Abbott said. ""We know this is important to begin to start reaching some level of preparation. You can't decide Aug. 1, 'Oh, let's go back to school,' and do it. You have to begin planning now."",Abbott said the state's decisions on reopening schools should be guided by health data like everything else.,""Let's say the medical information remains or improves from where we are today — they are taking the appropriate steps to begin the process toward reopening,"" Abbott said. But if conditions take a turn for the worse, Abbott added, schools should be prepared to deal with that as well.,""As the facts change, plans will change,"" Abbott said.,The shutdowns have cost schools millions in lost revenue, at least $19.5 million for A&M, a spokesperson told the Tribune two weeks ago. The federal stimulus programs gave A&M just under $40 million to be split between covering losses and financial aid for students.,Texas Tech received about $25.5 million in federal aid. Students at the Lubbock campus will return to classes with a list of precautions including social distancing and testing, Schovanec said in a letter to the campus Wednesday.,""We need to recognize that campus life will be different when we return in the fall,"" Schovanec said. ""We are developing several ways to reduce the density of groups in our student facilities, large lecture-based classrooms, and our popular campus areas. These same plans extend to special events, including athletics.,""Strategies for fall instruction will involve a blend of online and face-to-face classes for some students. We will also take extra precautions to protect the most vulnerable among us."",In an interview, Schovanec said he is working with his staff as well as the leaders of the medical schools in the Texas Tech System to come up with a plan. He said the group is considering nontraditional class schedules like mini-semesters within the larger ones and staggering class dismissals.,“One of the advantages to that approach is that students and faculty would have more flexibility in deciding when they will be on campus and when they feel safe,” Schovanec said.,He also said testing and retracing the steps of anyone exposed to the coronavirus will be integral to a safe reopening. However, Schovanec said it is too early to know what the scope of testing will be.,University policies have garnered considerable attention in the response to the coronavirus pandemic since the close quarters of dorms and student apartments could potentially accelerate the spread of the virus. But moving to online learning also presents challenges, especially for students who don't have stable housing or internet outside of school.,Football presents an even more complex challenge. Games in the fall in Texas can attract upwards of 100,000 fans, and ticket sales and television contracts are major revenue drivers for the schools.,Typically, A&M’s football season brings in $85 million in revenue, including donations and ticket sales. But Jeff Toole, chief financial officer for athletics, said the school is operating under the assumption that game attendance will drop, though early ticket sales have remained fairly steady so far.,“The social distancing in a 100,000-seat stadium ... that could be challenging,” A&M Athletics Director Ross Bjork said.,Still, things could change between now and football season. Abbott ,Dr. Anthony Fauci, who is leading the White House's public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, said this week that major sports might not be able to return to action this year.,College football schedules are set in a bifurcated manner. Each team plays in a conference, which sets a conference schedule of eight or nine games. Nonconference games are then arranged by the schools; usually two schools enter into contracts individually with other schools.,Sharp wants to ""make this happen,"" according to an A&M spokesman, but said he will defer to the governor, the A&M System Board of Regents, the NCAA and A&M's Southeastern Conference for the final decision.,SEC spokesman Herb Vincent said, ""Our current focus is on preparing to play the 2020 football season as scheduled."",Schovanec also acknowledged that other parties would have to sign off on playing football. But he also said sports are important beyond their entertainment value.,“Being able to play some part of the football schedule is crucial to our athletic budget,"" Schovanec said. ""We are very focused on trying to make sure that we can come to some sort of arrangement where there will be football.”,However, Schovanec said the fall season could come with a range of nontraditional changes like fewer games and earlier starts. He said packed stadiums are the least likely to return.,“I don’t expect that. However, I think it’s premature to make any statement about what will be the game-day environment,"" Schovanec said.

19,Texas A&M System employees were asked to teach office pet birds to say “howdy.” It didn’t go well.,"COLLEGE STATION — Last fall, employees in a Texas A&M University System office space were alerted that three parakeets had been placed in the building’s light-filled atrium, and that more were on the way.,They were to be greeted warmly: “The first word we would like to teach them is 'HOWDY!'"" an employee for Chancellor John Sharp wrote in an October 2018 email. “Please help them learn by addressing them this way when you see them.”,But — for at least a few days — the birds prompted a different reaction from some employees, who said in emails that their winged guests took to “flying around like crazy” and “don’t understand why we are chasing them.”,“Four birds landed on Cliff’s computer last night. Lona chased them out with a baby gate, while Wanda waved her hands like a crazy person so the bird would not fly down towards our area,” an employee wrote in an October 2018 email. “I hear 2 more birds will be arriving soon. Trying to hold it together over here… are we really spending time on birds?”,""This is not funny and this isn’t a good environment for the birds,” the employee wrote in a separate email. ""Maybe someone could recommend we buy a cage and put the birds in it, if we need to have birds, they should be contained.”,Another person asked a colleague in May if they had been ""'pooped' upon yet."", ,But the big parakeets’ freedom was short-lived.

20,Interim Texas A&M University president sets new tone for reforms planned under his predecessor,"Sign up for The Brief,Texas A&M University’s Interim President Mark Welsh III told faculty and staff in College Station on Wednesday that the university will largely stay the course on many unpopular organizational changes initiated by his predecessor.,But he said that he and his administration will closely monitor the changes and continue to gather feedback from faculty and staff to make sure the new policies work as they’re intended to and assess if they need to be tweaked or abandoned in the future.,“Changing out of something is as chaotic as changing into it, and it’s not any easier,” Welsh said about his decision not to reverse course on many of the changes already underway.,Welsh held a meeting with more than 600 faculty and staff Wednesday morning after his staff conducted a two-month review of former President M. Katherine Banks’ major organizational overhaul, known as The Path Forward. The plan, initiated in 2021, included 41 changes like reorganizing administrative offices, merging certain colleges, centralizing services and adding new academic programs.,Faculty and staff largely criticized the changes as poorly conceived and hastily executed, causing confusion among students and employees, and negatively affecting morale.,When Welsh was named interim president in late July, he immediately charged a team to analyze the impact of Banks’ changes. The team included Joe Pettibon, vice president for planning, assessment and strategy; Matt Fry, associate vice president for research; Deborah Wright, associate vice president for budget and planning; and Tim Scott, vice provost for student success. They set off on a listening tour across campus, which included more than 100 sessions with faculty and staff. The team then compiled their findings and recommendations into a report.,According to that report published a few weeks ago, Banks’ changes were largely panned by faculty and staff as a disaster that created unnecessary confusion and were extremely disruptive for students and faculty.,“The speed and scope of changes in structures and systems, as well as the lack of communication and transparency, placed our employees in difficult situations and limited their success, creating numerous occasions where processes were slowed or stopped, and where points of contact were unknown,” the report summary stated.,Nearly all respondents raised concerns with how the reorganization made it harder to access teaching space and staff offices — some faculty members were relocated across campus to different departments or lost spaces where they used to gather with colleagues.,Some departments, including the university library, were especially affected by the changes. About 25% of librarians chose to leave the university rather than following new rules that eliminated their tenure, the report stated.,Welsh walked faculty and staff through each of the recommendations made by his team, his final decisions based on those recommendations and his rationale behind the choices.,Welsh said he asked for broader feedback on the report. He told the crowd his office received more than 2,500 comments in response, which he used to make his final decisions.,Some of his decisions included moving forward with the creation of a school of visual and performing arts and of a journalism program, which was in question after the failed hiring of journalism professor Kathleen McElroy.,Welsh also shifted some administrative responsibilities back to department heads and faculty. In addition, he told faculty that the university would conduct a space allocation survey and that the university would reinstate a bachelors of science degree back in the veterinary medicine school, rather than place it in the college of arts and sciences, which he said was a major concern for students.,The most notable changes that Welsh announced were to reelevate the provost position to “make it clear the provost is number two [position] at Texas A&M” and to reinstate some offices under the provost’s purview.,Banks had restructured the provost's office and created a new position, the vice president of faculty affairs. The move separated Texas A&M from how the vast majority of universities, where provosts are typically considered the chief academic officer. Many faculty felt they lost advocacy with the restructuring.,Welsh said that the vice president for faculty affairs would now be considered the vice provost for faculty affairs and would report to the provost.,Welsh also said the university would conduct a capacity study to determine how to best respond to and plan for the university’s continued growth. Over the past decade, the flagship university grew from ,“So many stressors have to do with growth,” he said.,Welsh’s decision to stay the course on many initially unpopular changes has been met with a mostly positive response, largely because of the way he included faculty in discussions and the transparent communication with which he outlined his decisions.,“He provided a rationale for all decisions so that even when you disagreed with a decision, you could understand why the decision was made,” Faculty Senate President Tracy Hammond said in a statement after the meeting. “I, myself, disagreed with at least one of the recommendations, but I was comfortable with the decision made.”,At one point, Welsh said he would rather hear from faculty about how to move forward rather than an external consulting company, a comment that was met with cheers from the crowd.,Banks was largely criticized by faculty and staff for not involving them in the decision-making process and failing to communicate why certain changes were made.,Banks resigned in July amid internal turmoil after The Texas Tribune reported ,But long before the summer scandal, Banks and the Path Forward faced resistance from faculty and students who consistently raised concerns with the direction she was taking the university in and the way in which her administration was communicating its vision.,Banks served as the dean of Texas A&M’s engineering school before Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp tapped her in 2021 to become,Soon after, she hired MGT Consulting to review Texas A&M’s organizational structure and provide recommendations for change. She later announced 41 recommendations that she began to enact last year.,Changes included combining Texas A&M’s College of Liberal Arts, College of Science and College of Geosciences to create the College of Arts and Sciences. The university also launched a new School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts to house performance studies, dance and visualization programs under one roof. Other changes faced more criticism, including the restructuring of the university’s libraries.,Welsh said Wednesday that despite the anger over the changes to the university libraries, the vast majority of librarians said they wanted to stay the course with the current system because “they’re pretty traumatized by the changes” and didn’t want new ones.,Welsh announced that while they would continue implementing the overhaul to the libraries, the university would add $3.3 million to the library system’s operating budget, including $2.4 million that was previously removed from the library budget, and add $990,000 for salary adjustments.,Banks had also approved a restructuring of Texas A&M’s Qatar branch, including changes to which faculty can conduct research, faculty contract terms and reorganizing school leadership under one dean. Critics argued these changes will make it harder to recruit and retain talented faculty at the Middle East campus.,Welsh told faculty Wednesday they are still working on a report of recommendations related to the external campuses. They will also publish the recommendations and ask for feedback before making final decisions.,“The conversation can't end,” Welsh told faculty and staff. “The difference is we'll be looking through the windshield, not the rearview mirror, because it’s time to start looking forward, to continue the conversation and make it part of our normal routine. That's the way the university has to work.”,Professors long argued that Banks did not seek enough faculty input before approving those changes.,At the start of the 2022 academic year, the Faculty Senate ,Eight months later, a well-respected faculty group on campus said researchers at the flagship university had “serious concerns” with the Banks’ leadership, based on survey results from a poll the group conducted.,The group organized the poll in December after a well-respected chemist at Texas A&M, Karen Wooley, wrote a letter to Banks warning that many of the changes she had made since starting as president in 2021 were “causing substantial disruptions and threatening the integrity of this prestigious and precious institution.”,Hammond said that Welsh’s presentation Wednesday was a marked difference from how the prior administration interacted with professors and staff.,“The faculty are starting to feel that they can stop acting like they are walking on eggshells and take a deep breath,” she said. “In all appearances, it seems that we are finally moving forward together as one as we should have been doing all along.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

21,"Race was a factor in Black professor’s failed hiring, Texas A&M department head says","Sign up for The Brief,A Texas A&M University department head involved in the failed efforts to recruit a Black journalism professor said Friday that then-President M. Katherine Banks interfered in the hiring process and that race was a factor in university officials’ decision to water down her job offer.,“The unusual level of scrutiny being given to the hiring of Dr. [Kathleen] McElroy was acknowledged by one administrator to have been based, at least in part, on race,"" said Hart Blanton, head of the department of communications and journalism. ""Regardless of the source of any such pressure, I understand it to be illegal for any employer—much less a public university—to subject a job candidate to stricter scrutiny due to her race or color."",McElroy, a 1981 Texas A&M graduate and the former director of the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism, turned down an offer to reboot A&M’s journalism program earlier this month after a ,What originally was a tenure-track offer was reduced to a five-year position after conservative backlash arose in response to the hire. It was then lessened again to a one-year position from which she could be fired at any time. McElroy ultimately walked away from the negotiations, saying the final offer “makes it clear they don’t want me there.”,The collapse of the hire sparked outrage and concerns about academic freedom from faculty. Blanton said that Banks — who resigned from her position earlier Friday in response to the fallout — misled members of the Faculty Senate during a meeting Wednesday by telling them the decision to change McElroy’s job offer was made solely within Blanton’s department and without her involvement. Banks ,“To the contrary, President Banks injected herself into the process atypically and early on,” Blanton said.,He also said he was “shocked” to see his signature was used in the revised versions of McElroy’s job offer without his consent. He said he shared materials related to the incident with the university’s legal staff on Thursday, the night before Banks’ resignation was made public.,Blanton's one-page letter did not go into specifics, such as how Banks became involved in the process or who acknowledged that race was a factor in the debacle.,Laylan Copelin, vice chancellor for marketing and communications at the A&M System, said Friday that the system is in the early stages of an investigation into McElroy’s hiring process. That inquiry, he said, will include interviews with Blanton, Banks and others and a review relevant documents and communications. He added that system leaders “have read, heard and understood the concerns of our Aggie community stemming from the attempt to hire Dr. Kathleen McElroy.”,“We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened and why, learn from the mistakes and do better in the future,” he said.,Blanton, meanwhile, applauded Banks’ departure.,“Texas A&M cannot have its leaders misleading the faculty, public, or policymakers about how we conduct business,” he said.,The fallout from the fiasco, which has garnered national attention, has extended beyond the president’s office.,José Luis Bermúdez, the interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, ,The Texas Legislative Black Caucus and Texas NAACP joined the call for an independent investigation.,“The academic school year has not even begun and we have seen the reputation of one of our flagship public higher education systems crumble because of radical anti-DEI influences,” Legislative Black Caucus Chair ,Faculty and free speech advocates pointed to the fact that vocal conservative groups were raising issues about McElroy's previous employment at The New York Times and her support for diversity in newsrooms after her hiring was announced. The Rudder Association, which touts itself as a group of Aggies defending the core values of A&M, said it complained to university administration about the hire. The website Texas Scorecard, whose publisher is hardline conservative activist Michael Quinn Sullivan, wrote an article calling her a ""'diversity' advocate."",McElroy has said she was told that not everyone was pleased by her joining the faculty. She has studied news media and race, with a focus on how to improve diversity and inclusion within newsrooms, and spent her career covering other areas like food, sports and obituaries. Her master's thesis focused on the obituaries of civil rights leaders.,The botched hiring comes as universities are facing scrutiny and resistance over their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

22,Research leaders at Texas A&M University raise “serious concerns” with President Kathy Banks’ leadership,"Sign up for The Brief,Eight months after Texas A&M University professors ,In a letter sent to Banks last week, the Council of Principal Investigators, an elected group of faculty and researchers who help oversee research activity at the school, said responses from “principal investigators” — faculty and researchers within the A&M system who are allowed to oversee research grants — revealed “widespread discontent.”,Overall, the poll found that these principal investigators do not trust the current administration, and many feel that administrators are cultivating an environment of fear and intimidation on campus. In the survey responses, research faculty lamented that the university has made too many interim appointments and “unqualified leadership appointments” rather than conducting national searches to fill open positions, which has led to “incompetent handling of issues.” They also felt the administration was “insincere” about their efforts to have faculty involved in long-term planning and decision making.,“We encourage University-leadership to consider this and prior feedback … as an opportunity to adjust leadership style to build an atmosphere of mutual trust,” the letter read.,The council decided to organize a poll in December after a well-respected chemist at Texas A&M, Karen Wooley, wrote a letter to Banks warning that many of the changes she had made since starting as president in 2021 were, “causing substantial disruptions and threatening the integrity of this prestigious and precious institution.” Last August, the Faculty Senate passed a ,Banks declined an interview request with The Texas Tribune. In a statement, she said she addressed many of these concerns in ,“I am dedicated to enhancing interaction with faculty and staff and have enacted several initiatives outlined in the memo to allow for greater accessibility, more frequent communication and opportunities for faculty and staff to provide feedback,” she said. “As I have stated in the past, I am committed to shared governance and will continue to place a strong focus on regularly assessing engagement with the greater campus community.”,Banks served as the dean of Texas A&M’s engineering school before Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp tapped her to become,Changes include combining A&M’s College of Liberal Arts, College of Science and College of Geosciences into one College of Arts and Sciences. The university also launched a new School of Performance, Visualization and Fine Arts to house performance studies, dance and visualization programs under one roof. Faculty were especially critical of the restructuring of the university’s libraries, which resulted in librarians losing tenure status.,Banks also approved a restructuring of the branch of Texas A&M in Qatar that offers engineering undergraduate and graduate degrees. As of Sept 1., faculty who work in areas beyond engineering are no longer allowed to conduct research. Faculty who teach in areas that can grant degrees shifted from rolling contracts to fixed-term contracts for up to five years, and faculty who teach in non-degree-granting areas are on annual contracts, which critics argue will create more job insecurity. Finally, Banks consolidated school leadership under one dean.,Critics argue these changes will make it harder to recruit and retain talented faculty at the Middle East campus.,Wooley’s letter, sent to Banks on Dec. 14, spread like wildfire across campus and online. The following day, the council organized the poll, giving faculty until Jan. 2 to indicate if they supported Wooley’s letter and provide additional feedback.,The letter from council leadership said 89% of more than 237 faculty members supported Wooley’s concerns, while additional respondents submitted detailed comments online and “expressed additional misgivings.” Overall, the 237 respondents represent 14% of the estimated 2,000 principal investigators on campus.,In a statement Monday, Texas A&M spokesperson Kelly Brown said the survey was not “scientific.”,“[I]t was a single question and, based on the explanation given in their own summary, it’s unknown if any of the respondents voted multiple times, so it’s not even clear if the data is reliable,” Brown stated.,According to the letter, council leaders shared these results with Banks at a meeting on March 6.,“Dr. Banks was attentive to the themes conveyed by the [Council of Principal Investigators Executive Committee] members present at the meeting, and aptly countered with the fact that while criticisms have value, the provision of actionable recommendations that can address shortcomings could be of much greater value,” a timeline of events included with the letter reads.,The council leaders acknowledged that Banks and her administration have taken steps since December to improve communication and hold monthly meetings with the executive committee. They also included additional recommendations to increase engagement between those who oversee research grants, faculty and administration.,Other recommendations to improve trust and transparency between Banks and research faculty include enhanced communication and clearer avenues for people to provide feedback. The group also suggested that Banks appoint people in the office of faculty affairs to serve as faculty advocates and oversee potential solutions. And the group recommended Banks conduct external searches for all high-level administrative positions, which would allow internal candidates to apply along with outside candidates.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

23,West Texas A&M University receives $20 million gift for new institute to promote “Texas Panhandle values”,"Sign up for The Brief,West Texas A&M University has received a $20 million gift — the largest gift from an individual donor in the university’s history — to create a new institute to promote American values.,The donation is a gift from Amarillo businessman Alex Fairly and his wife, Cheryl. Both graduated from West Texas A&M.,The new university center will be called the Hill Institute, named after the university’s second president, Joseph Hill.,“The mission of The Hill Institute is to encourage reflection upon the importance of ten West Texas, Texas, and American values and, through study and scholarship, promulgate the values among students within the diverse disciplines of the University and the extended community,” a flier for the new institute reads.,The institute’s website,“Ultimately, the goal is to have the work of scholars impact every profession and area of study represented on [West Texas A&M’s] campus through the firmly held and highly esteemed values of The Institute,” the newly created website reads. “A challenge in contemporary higher education is the retreat of disciplines into silos with little common ground from which to produce engaged citizens. The Institute will illuminate the founding values of our nation as embodied in our region as a means of cementing intellectual processes to make the world a better place to live.”,The Texas A&M Board of Regents approved the creation of the institute in February 2022 and the university had been searching for a donor to fund the center since. West Texas A&M President Walter Wendler said he worked with Fairly on crafting the institute’s mission for three years. He said he sees the university and this new institute as a “launching pad for the future of higher education.”,“Higher education is in the need to continually be reshaped, especially now with forces at work that affect every aspect of university life and the students who come here to study [and] the faculty and staff who come here to work who take care of their families,” Wendler said Wednesday during an event to announce the new center. “The enterprise of higher education is being drawn into a universalist perspective, one which says all institutions should all look the same. There are many forces at work that drive us in that direction and it's a mistake.”,Wendler, who has served as the university’s president since 2016, is known for being outspoken about his Christian beliefs, often publishing articles about his faith on his personal website and in messages to the university community.,In the spring, the university's faculty,Wendler emerged from the controversy unscathed. He’s also received early support from a federal judge who is overseeing a lawsuit that a campus LGBTQ student group filed against Wendler in March, alleging he violated their free speech rights by banning the drag performance. Recently, ,Lt. Gov. ,“This is the America that all America used to be, it should be again,” Patrick said of the sprawling, pastoral region whose rural counties and smaller outposts have long been a Republican stronghold. “These are American values here.”,The Hill Institute will seek to embed students and faculty members “to better understand how these values impact daily life, create a better community, prepare us for engaged citizenship and shape our nation,” Wendler said. “We want the mission of the Hill Institute to have an impact far beyond our region.”,“Hill scholars” will also share their ideas and insights through regular publications and speaking engagements, according to a press release announcing the institute.,University officials said the institute will be funded through private donations, not state resources.,Alex Fairly, the donor funding the Hill Institute, told the crowd Wednesday that when Wendler approached him to serve on the committee for the university’s comprehensive fundraising campaign, the One West campaign, he was skeptical that his values aligned with those of higher education broadly.,“We wrestled with the decision to give to higher education because we were no longer sure we trusted the direction we saw higher education taking,” Fairly said. “What Texas and America need today is a leadership of intelligence and virtue. Education must take more account of permanent values.”,Fairly said he and his wife were convinced to make their donation because of Wendler, who they believe is leading higher education in the right direction, and the principles of Joseph Hill, who often spoke publicly about the values of the region.,According to the Texas Ethics Commission, Fairly has sporadically donated to local and state Republican lawmakers over the past few years. In 2022, Fairly and his entity, ,This year, Fairly and his wife donated $145,000 to the Defend Texas Liberty PAC, a political action committee led by former Rep. Jonathan Stickland. The PAC was a vocal supporter of Paxton after he was impeached by the Texas House this spring and throughout his impeachment trial in the Senate. In June, the PAC donated $3 million to Patrick, who presided over the trial.,At the event Wednesday, Patrick told Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp that he would work with him to get similar institutes at all A&M campuses by the end of Sharp’s tenure.,“Start from here, make this a national policy program because we need leaders in America,” he told the crowd. “We need to turn our face back to God. Stand on that foundation.”,This isn’t the first time Patrick has supported an institute at a public university that had the financial backing of conservative donors.,In 2021, ,Patrick later said,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, Texas A&M University System, University of Texas at Austin and West Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

24,Texas A&M vet school tells Texas Tech: This state ain't big enough for the two of us,"CANYON — Veterinarian Gregg Veneklasen loves what he calls “this part of the world.” He loves the natural beauty of the Palo Duro Canyon, the second-largest canyon in the country, only minutes from his home. He loves the peaceful vistas stretching across heartland plains. He loves the temperate weather, the friendly people and the animals he works with in his horse clinic near downtown.,But few young people want to move to rural areas like Canyon to practice veterinary medicine, and Veneklasen can’t blame them.,“If you’re a young guy, what in the hell would you want to live in Sunray, Texas, for? Insane,” Veneklasen said, referring to another Texas Panhandle city. “And raise a family? More insanity.”,Rural areas around the state are facing shortages of veterinarians as fewer young graduates want to practice away from urban amenities. In places like the Texas Panhandle — an agricultural focal point for the country — not having enough vets can pose serious consequences to livestock and food production. Texas livestock include over 1 million hogs, nearly a million sheep and over 12 million cattle. In 2016, there were only about 180 vets working on livestock in rural Texas areas., ,Texas Tech University hopes to remedy that problem by opening its own veterinary school in Amarillo in the middle of the Panhandle. It would be the second veterinary school in the state. But Texas A&M University, which operates the only veterinary school in Texas, in College Station, and already sends veterinary students to study minutes away from where Tech hopes to build its new program, is less than enthused.,“It is completely redundant,” Eleanor Green, dean of the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine, said about Tech’s proposed vet school. “There’s nothing they’re talking about doing that we don’t already do.”,Tech announced its desire to build a vet school in 2015, expecting to open in 2019, but the idea of a Tech vet school goes back to the 1970s. The plans got off to a sputtering start: the university shelved its proposals to prioritize medical school expansion. Tech announced it was ,A&M, whose program is ranked among the best in the world, has protested the newest proposals, saying Tech’s plans would be an inefficient use of state funds. But Tech said its program would complement A&M and fill a need that no one institution could.,One of the driving tenets of Tech’s new vet school is its non-traditional education model, said Guy Loneragan, a veterinarian and Tech professor who has developed much of the curriculum for the new school. Based on a teaching model developed at the University of Calgary, Tech’s program would send students out to do residency-like learning in participating clinics across rural areas.,Doing so, Loneragan said, would give students more exposure to rural practices as opposed to keeping students in a teaching hospital on campus far from the communities that are facing vet,A&M’s vet school plans to expand its freshman class size from 132 to 162 by next fall, which would be the largest veterinary class size in the United States or Canada, according a 2017 report commissioned by Tech. The report said expanding class size more would risk the quality of education.,About three-fourths of qualified vet school applicants are not admitted to A&M’s program because of class size constraints, the report said, pushing more applicants to seek education out of state. In the 1990s, close to 80 percent of Texas vet licenses were granted to A&M graduates. That percentage has steadily declined as the number of vet licenses in the state has increased exponentially.,“Texas is blessed with one of the world’s best vet schools, and for many good reasons,” Loneragan said. “But the growth in Texas has exceeded the capacity of any one institution and we’re developing a complementary program that together will more fully meet the needs of Texas than any one institution is doing at the moment.”, , ,Green, the dean of A&M’s vet school, rejected the idea that the need for rural vets couldn’t be filled by a single school. West Texas A&M, located in Canyon, less than 20 miles from Amarillo, houses internships, rotations and research opportunities for A&M vet students in a rural setting. A&M also places students in residencies in rural areas while offering them the benefits of a world-class teaching hospital as well.,A&M recruits students from rural communities and mentors them as undergraduates to find students who are likely to practice in rural areas. President Walter Wendler of West Texas A&M visited every high school in the Panhandle's,Green added that A&M only accepts students it knows will excel in its program, dismissing the narrative presented in Tech’s 2017 report that A&M is not capable of meeting demand based on its admissions numbers. A&M has also built a new veterinary school facility on its College Station campus, which Green said allows the school to welcome larger classes to accommodate the demand for instruction that Loneragan said it could not, without sacrificing quality of instruction. A&M has the potential to increase vet class size by a couple hundred more, depending on need.,Young vets want to move somewhere where their spouses can have job prospects and there are amenities for their children, making urban areas more appealing, Green said. Strategic recruiting of people who are already familiar with rural communities and nurturing students who demonstrate a real desire to serve in rural areas are far more effective strategies than increasing the total number of admitted vet students, she added. A 2016 report from The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board said building a new vet school could saturate the market for urban vets without fulfilling the needs of rural communities.,“Going into rural practice is as much of a lifestyle choice as anything,” Green said. “It’s going to be very difficult to get someone from a densely populated urban area to go live in a rural area with a population of 300.”,Loneragan said the new vet school would also recruit vets from rural areas. He cited the Tech-commissioned report, which said more than 90 percent of Texas vets are employed, and disputed the idea the school would cause a job market saturation.,Taylor Powell, a veterinary intern from the small North Texas town of Henrietta, graduated in May from A&M's vet school. Powell, who is also a Tech graduate, currently works at a equine clinic in Lamesa in West Texas, where she focuses on racehorse treatment and surgery and treats dogs and cats as well as livestock.,Most vet school graduates end up working in metropolitan areas treating small animals like household pets, according to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board report.

""So my goal has always been to find a way to give back "",The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board report recommended funding a loan forgiveness program to tackle the rural vet shortage. One of the key barriers for young vets to move to rural areas is the high loans they carry after vet school and the low financial returns offered in rural areas, said Veneklasen, the Canyon vet.,Forgiving loans would cost a fraction of the $4.1 million the state appropriated to launch the Tech project and the $90 million the university has raised to construct the new vet school facilities, Green said.,“It’s obviously a much better investment to increase the support for and capabilities of a world-class veterinary school, and I’m so proud of that for Texas,” Green said. “And all we need is a little, tiny bit more to do far more than a new vet school could ever do, right now.”,Loneragan said the new vet school would eventually wean off of state funding and become self-sufficient within eight years of opening.,The city of Amarillo, where the new vet school is slated to be built, is also excited about the prospect of new academic activity. Reagan Hales, marketing director at the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation, cited Tech’s feasibility report, which predicted the new vet school would have an annual economic impact of $76 million — that’s new money flowing into the city from more jobs and markets created by the school.,The Amarillo Economic Development Corporation, which is funded by municipal tax dollars, pledged between $15 million and $69 million to go toward construction of the new vet school. With additional private contributions, Tech,Barry Allbrecht, president of the Amarillo Economic Development Corporation, said the corporation supports all universities and has not engaged in the debates between A&M and Tech.,Veneklasen is opposed to Tech’s vet school, but he recognizes the need to keep vets in rural areas. He characterized Tech’s vet school as a misguided use of funds that could go to other uses, like public education in the Panhandle.,Though Veneklasen said he makes a comfortable living — he is renowned among vets for his work with equine cloning — and enjoys the rural lifestyle, he said the need to attract new talent to the area is real. He said he and many of his rural colleagues are confident that A&M can deliver on the need and that Tech’s vet school and the ensuing drama are detracting attention.,“It’s not a football game,” Veneklasen said.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas Tech University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

25,Texas A&M University System bans diversity statements from job applications,"Sign up for The Brief,Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp has directed leaders of its 11 universities and eight agencies to stop asking job candidates for statements about their commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion in their applications.,Last month, Gov. ,Sharp said Thursday he directed all A&M system universities and agencies to review their employment and admissions practices. He said he is standardizing hiring practices systemwide by limiting faculty and staff applications to a cover letter, curriculum vitae, statements on research or teaching philosophies and professional references.,“No university or agency in the A&M System will admit any student, nor hire any employee based on any factor other than merit,” Sharp said in a directive sent to university leaders Thursday.,Texas State University System Chancellor Brian McCall shared similar instructions to the seven,""We will continue to ensure our policies are consistent with state and federal laws, and we stand against any actions or activities that promote discrimination in the guise of diversity, equity and inclusion,"" Khator wrote in the email.,Universities and system agencies were also directed to make sure websites and printed materials related to employment and admissions practices reflect these changes. Texas A&M University ,Abbott’s order prompted multiple universities to make changes to hiring, particularly in the practice of asking job candidates to submit diversity statements, which are typically one- to two-page letters in which job candidates are asked to share their experiences working with diverse populations and their commitment to helping a diverse group of students succeed. Critics have characterized them as political litmus tests.,Last week, the University of Texas System ,UT System board Chair Kevin Eltife said last week that while the system strives to promote diversity among its students and faculty, “certain DEI efforts have strayed from the original intent to now imposing requirements and actions that, rightfully so, has raised the concerns of our policymakers around those efforts on campuses across our entire state.” The university has not responded to requests for more specifics about which efforts he was referring to.,Texas A&M University in College Station had already directed departments to no longer require diversity statements in future job postings, according to emails obtained by The Texas Tribune.,Texas Tech University also ,Conservative lawmakers and advocates criticize DEI initiatives as political litmus tests that require potential or current employees and students to subscribe to progressive political views that squelch certain types of free speech and prioritize social justice over merit and achievement.,“The innocuous sounding notion of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) has been manipulated to push policies that expressly favor some demographic groups to the detriment of others,” Gardner Pate, Abbott’s chief of staff, wrote in his letter to university and state agency leaders last month.,When many public and private universities were founded, they admitted only white men as students. Over time, universities opened their doors to other groups, including people of color and women, often as a result of legal challenges in which judges ruled that policies prohibiting certain groups from enrolling were discriminatory.,Yet even as universities started to accept students from more diverse backgrounds, many universities have acknowledged over time they have not created environments that serve certain groups well, including people of color, women, disabled students and veterans.,As the state’s demographics have shifted, universities have created offices and hired staff with the intent to ensure schools were serving these students. Many schools recommitted to these efforts after George Floyd’s murder, when students demanded schools commit to fighting systemic racism within higher education and offer more academic and emotional support to help them succeed.,Many Texas universities were already making efforts to better support students of color, low-income students and first-generation students as these institutions ponder their role in preparing the state’s future workforce and helping students from all backgrounds earn a postsecondary credential or degree.,In recent months, conservative politicians and advocates have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion practices, criticizing efforts to help underrepresented groups as products of left-wing ideology meant to reinforce liberal ideas about structural racism and discrimination.,At a panel on diversity, equity and inclusion practices at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation’s annual policy summit Thursday, state Sen. ,“We [have to] pass these laws to have that backup for our university and university regents who are doing some kind of patchwork quilt of different regulations and different policies in our various state universities so the state provides that uniformity,” Middleton said. “So that’s another important thing on the Legislature acting on this subject and making sure it’s the same for all.”,Lt.

Instead, he will join the system’s remaining campus heads in relying on annual appointment letters and system policy to govern the terms of his employment at the College Station-based campus.,Young, who was appointed A&M president in 2015, currently has a five-year agreement with the system that guarantees him $1 million in annual pay. The terms were expected to be renewed for an additional five years unless Young or system officials indicated otherwise before April 30, 2019.,In an April 16 letter, A&M System Chancellor John Sharp explained that Young’s contract would not be renewed and stressed it was “in no way a reflection” of his performance as president.,“While your employment agreement allows for a 5-year renewal term, the System desires to bring your employment status into line with our other university presidents, none of whom has an employment agreement,” Sharp wrote in a letter addressed to Young and obtained by The Texas Tribune under open record laws.,“We look forward to your continued service as our president,” Sharp added., ,Young previously served as president of the University of Utah and the,A graduate of Harvard Law School, Young was the highest-compensated university president in Texas in 2017 and among the top dozen nationwide, according to a ,Young said in a statement that he loves being part of the university and is excited “about its trajectory of success.”,“As an administrator and employer, I understand and appreciate the need for consistency in the format of appointment letters among presidents throughout the A&M system.

But the ,During the failed negotiation process, McElroy said that Bermúdez told her he could not protect her from university leaders facing pressure to fire her over “DEI hysteria” surrounding her appointment. Bermúdez advised McElroy to stay in her tenured role at UT-Austin.,McElroy, a 1981 Texas A&M graduate, was the director of the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Journalism between 2018 and 2022. She walked away from Texas A&M’s job offer after the university watered down the agreement.,Bermúdez’s resignation marks the latest chapter in a tale that began ,The first version of the job offer McElroy received, which she signed at a ceremony in June, showed the university offered to hire her as a tenured professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism and as the revived journalism program’s director.,Following the backlash, McElroy agreed to a second offer that amounted to a five-year contract position without tenure.,The third offer, which McElroy rejected last week, offered a one-year contract and emphasized that she could be terminated at any time.,“I feel damaged by this entire process,” said McElroy, who is a Black woman and a native of Houston’s Third Ward, and whose father, George A. McElroy, was a pioneering Black journalist. “I’m being judged by race, maybe gender. And I don’t think other folks would face the same bars or challenges. And it seems that my being an Aggie, wanting to lead an Aggie program to what I thought would be prosperity, wasn’t enough.”,Days after the ,Tracy Hammond, speaker for the Texas A&M Faculty Senate, wrote in a letter addressed to both university president M.

Her contract expires at the end of August, according to the letter. She will continue working at the university as a faculty member.,Van Zandt wrote that her confidence in the university’s commitment to uphold practices that advance diversity, equity and inclusion wavered with the installation of Banks as president, but she believed that “faculty and administrators had the autonomy to pursue these ideals in their respective positions.”,However, she began to question that a few weeks ago as plans emerged for university leadership to implement a ,“When the news broke last week of the clear interference of politics in the hiring and tenure processes of the Head of the new Department of Journalism, my confidence in the integrity of these processes and my ability to ensure it was lost,” Van Zandt wrote. “I no longer feel that I can assure faculty going through the tenure and promotion process that the process will be done fairly and without interference from political forces. I can no longer confidently communicate to faculty candidates our commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity, nor the integrity of our hiring, tenure, promotion and retention efforts.”,Meanwhile, the state’s Legislative Black Caucus and NAACP chapter on Monday said the “targeted attack” on McElroy showed “how outspoken anti-DEI sentiments can discriminatorily infringe professional hiring procedures under the guise of meritocracy.”,“We said this during the legislative session, these radical anti-DEI campaigns will detrimentally obstruct the future of higher education in Texas and taint the reputations of our competitive top-tier institutions,” caucus Chair Rep. ,On Tuesday, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression ,""FIRE seeks clarity about this decision-making process to ensure TAMU, a public university, is meeting its First Amendment obligations,"" the letter reads.

33,Federal judge sides with West Texas A&M University president who canceled campus drag show,"Sign up for The Brief,One of Texas’ most notoriously conservative federal judges issued an opinion this week supporting restrictions to drag shows, which stands apart from many other federal rulings that have struck down similar bans in other states as unconstitutional.  ,U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk said that West Texas A&M University President Walter Wendler acted within his authority when he canceled a campus drag show. Students sued Wendler in March, alleging the president violated their free speech rights by banning a fundraiser featuring drag performers, but Kacsmaryk declined the request for injunctive relief. ,In his opinion, ,Kacsmaryk’s opinion stands in contrast with several other decisions over free speech lawsuits related to drag shows. Around the country and in states run by Republicans, federal judges in ,Observers say Kacsmaryk’s decision is concerning because it represents an extreme departure from precedent in this area. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to play a deciding factor as the numerous lawsuits over drag show bans make their way through the legal system. It’s unclear how Kacsmaryk’s decision could be factored in, as the West Texas A&M case concerns campus activities.  ,“FIRE strongly disagrees with the court’s approach to First Amendment analysis and its conclusions,” JT Morris, senior attorney for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a national group representing the students that advocates for free speech on campuses, said in a statement. “We will appeal, and our fight for the expressive rights of these brave college students will continue.”,The contrasting decision comes six months after an LGBTQ+ student group attempted to host the drag performance on campus. ,In March, Wendler sent a letter to students, faculty and staff at West Texas A&M University ,Days later, ,Drag shows frequently feature men dressing as women in exaggerated styles and have been a mainstay in the LGBTQ+ community for decades. Drag performers say their work is an expression of queer joy — and a form of constitutionally-protected speech about societal gender norms.,LGBTQ+ groups and performers made similar claims in another federal lawsuit that challenges a Texas law that restricts drag shows from being performed in front of children. U.S. District Judge David Hittner temporarily blocked the law, arguing that banning drag shows is ,But Kacsmaryk offered a differing assessment in his Thursday order. He said the students’ definition of “expressive conduct” failed to meet the necessary standards to “decide a Free Speech campus case.”,The Amarillo-based judge argued that even if the drag show is lawful, the university can regulate it in the interest of protecting children. The organizers said the event was open to children accompanied by a parent or guardian. Kacsmaryk added that Wendler is immune from consequences stemming from his decision to cancel the drag show because the university president was acting as a government official within his authority.  ,The Office of the Attorney General quickly took notice of Kacsmaryk’s order, requesting Judge Hittner ,Brian Klosterboer, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas who is suing the state over the drag ban, said the two decisions concern different arenas: the West Texas A&M lawsuit concerns campus activities, while the new law is a statewide restriction. ,Klosterboer said he hopes the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit will overturn Kacsmaryk’s order, which he described as going “against the great weight of Supreme Court decisions.” ,As The Texas Tribune's signature event of the year, ","Sept. 22, 2023",Texas Tribune,0,0,sadness
34,Texas A&M leaders’ text messages show desire to counteract perceived liberal agenda in higher education,"Sign up for The Brief,Two years ago during M.

Her plans included dozens of structural changes meant to streamline and better organize the largest public university in the state.,But ,“Kathy [Banks] told us multiple times the reason we were going to combine [the colleges of] arts and sciences together was to control the liberal nature that those professors brought to campus,” regent Jay Graham wrote to regent David Baggett in June as they were discussing the university’s plans to hire journalism professor and former New York Times editor Kathleen O. McElroy. “[W]e were going to start a journalism department to get high-quality conservative Aggie students into the journalism world to help direct our message. This won’t happen with this type of hire!”,Those messages were released ,The messages show that many board members, who are gubernatorial appointees, had concerns with McElroy’s perceived left-leaning credentials, including that she taught at the University of Texas at Austin and previously worked at The New York Times. At least some of them displayed a desire to promote conservative causes at the flagship campus and a blatant resistance to recruiting someone who they believed would work counter to those goals.,“While it is wonderful for a successful Aggie to want to come back to Texas A&M to be a tenured professor and build something this important from scratch, we must look at her résumé and her statements made an opinion pieces and public interviews,” regent Mike Hernandez wrote to Banks and system Chancellor John Sharp, expressing disappointment that the board learned of the hire after it had been announced.,“The New York Times is one of the leading main stream media sources in our country. It is common knowledge that they are biased and progressive leaning. The same exact thing can be said about the university of Texas,” he continued.,Those perspectives are consistent with Texas conservatives’ recent attempts to counteract what they view as a liberal agenda within Texas’ public universities.,“People on the right think that the left controls education, and they’ve been trying to wrestle that control away,” said Jennifer Mercieca, a communications professor at Texas A&M who focuses on the intersection of democracy and communication. “Unfortunately, our journalism program got caught in the middle of that.”,In Texas, Lt. Gov. ,“People have had it with the intolerance of any ideas but progressive, DEI, propaganda-ish kinds of ideas on campus,” said Sherry Sylvester, a former aide for Patrick who now works as a public policy fellow at the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation and was an ardent supporter of the legislation to eliminate DEI programs this past session. “That is a big effort, a big movement.”,The impact of that movement was on display in the records Texas A&M released this week surrounding the failed effort to recruit McElroy.,Soon after making an initial offer to McElroy, Banks communicated that she wanted to push the announcement until after this year’s regular legislative session ended. At the time, university leaders, including those at Texas A&M, were negotiating with lawmakers over the DEI legislation, as well as state funding for public universities.,“Bottom line is that the NYT connection is poor optics during this particular legislative session,” Jose Bermúdez, interim dean of the college of arts and science, said to Hart Blanton, chair of the communications and journalism department, via text message on May 11.,Meanwhile, regents expressed disdain for media and academics they saw as liberal leaning. While regents approve tenure, it is unusual for them to get involved in university-level hires. The Texas A&M regents oversee 11 public universities and eight state agencies that employ more than 26,000 faculty members across the state.,Higher education experts say that education has long been characterized as political. Recent efforts in places like Texas, North Carolina and Florida have picked up partially because of how well the Republican base responds to the accusations.,“The notion of woke ideology and how it supposedly has done all this damage to things has just risen as a political talking point,” said Holden Thorp, former chancellor of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, now a professor at George Washington University. “It’s easy to say the universities are the places that you want to attack this,” he said, noting that the argument has increasingly shown to poll well among conservatives.,According to the internal report A&M released Thursday, Banks received calls from six to seven regents after Texas Scorecard, a conservative website, wrote an article about McElroy that painted her as a “DEI proponent” for her prior research to improve diversity in newsrooms. Board member Sam Torn emailed a quote from the article to board Chair Bill Mahomes stating he wanted an explanation before he could approve McElroy’s tenure.,The internal report revealed that Banks was heavily involved in behind-the-scenes discussions to walk back the original offer given to McElroy, contradicting Banks’ public statements that she had no knowledge of changes to the offer. ,The internal report showed that regents also raised questions about whether they could approve tenure for McElroy even though she already had been selected through the university’s standard hiring process.,“Granting tenure to somebody with this background is going to be a difficult sell for many on the [board of regents],” Hernandez said in an email to Banks and Sharp. “My sincere hope is that you both will figure out a way to completely put the brakes on this, so we all can discuss this further. If it’s truly too far down the road for you all to agree to that, the board majority can decide how to proceed and take the heat for the final call.”,Thorp said the regents’ meddling in the university’s hiring process overstepped their role.,“When they approve tenure, what they’re doing is saying that they have confidence in the administration to carry out the process that they said,” Thorp said. “The role of the board is to rule against it if for some reason they think the process wasn’t followed. Well, in this case, the process wasn’t followed, not because of the content or anything, but because [Banks] didn’t put the case forward because of politics.”,Some of the regents also took issue with what they perceived as McElroy’s bias regarding conservative viewpoints.,“We can’t just give people a set of facts anymore,” McElroy said in an interview on the public radio program “Here & Now” in 2021. “I think we know that and we have to tell our students that. This is not about getting two sides of a story or three sides of a story, if one side is illegitimate. I think now you cannot cover education, you cannot cover criminal justice, you can’t cover all of these institutions without recognizing how all these institutions were built.”,Sylvester with TPPF pointed to that quote as the reason she was against McElroy’s hiring for the journalism program. She declined to comment on the regents’ text messages but said her organization wants to see more free inquiry within higher education.,“No one is looking for a conservative ideology to drive higher ed,” she said. “But taxpayers and conservative leaders no longer want to underwrite a left-wing, divisive ideology that permeates so much of the curriculum.”,Thorp said that as the politicization of higher education increases and decisions are made based on politics over policy and procedure, universities become “ungovernable.”,“I’m certainly not defending Kathy Banks and her dishonest actions in this, but part of the reason why she resorted to that, probably, is that she didn’t have many other choices,” said Thorp, referring to her role in watering down McElroy’s job offer. “Every time you have to do something, you’re facing this intractable situation where you’re either going to get the campus against you or get the board against you. And that’s how not functional organizations work.”,Mercieca at Texas A&M said the internal report revealed how McElroy’s hiring was a victim of intervention that creates distrust within what are supposed to be democratic processes within universities.,“What we learned yesterday is that all of those institutional processes and procedures can be overruled by fiat, by powerful others,” she said. “It’s not democratic.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, the Texas A&M University System, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, The New York Times and the University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

35,A&M faculty leaders decry “appearance of outside influence” in botched hiring of journalism professor,"Sign up for The Brief,An association of Texas A&M faculty on Friday condemned the university’s administration for its role ,In a letter obtained by The Texas Tribune, Tracy Hammond, speaker for the Texas A&M Faculty Senate, said the group’s executive committee “decries the appearance of outside influence in the hiring and promotion of faculty.”,The letter comes three days after the Tribune reported that McElroy ended contract negotiations with the university, which had previously celebrated her intention to leave a tenured position at the University of Texas at Austin to revive the A&M journalism department.,Negotiations between McElroy and A&M became fraught in recent weeks, McElroy told the Tribune. And A&M employees suggested a vocal network of constituents within the university system expressed issues with her having worked at The New York Times and her support for diversity in newsrooms.,Hammond, in the letter addressed to both the university’s president, M. Katherine Banks, and chancellor, John Sharp, said faculty members were worried about the precedent this event sets.,“We believe we share the common goal of preserving Texas A&M University as a premier institution with an outstanding reputation,” Hammond said. “But for that to happen, there must be an acknowledgement that outside influence is detrimental to that goal and efforts must be taken to preclude that from recurring.”,A spokesperson for the university said officials received the letter and would respond next week. And a spokesperson for the Texas A&M University System said in a statement that its leaders agree there is a common goal with the faculty.,“Chancellor John Sharp has great confidence and faith in the faculty and is committed to keeping Texas A&M University a premier institution of higher education,” said Laylan Copelin, spokesperson for the A&M System.,McElroy’s decision to end contract negotiations is a dramatic reversal to the celebrated welcome she received after A&M first publicly announced she was leaving her position at UT-Austin to revive the A&M journalism program.,However, McElroy said that after the fanfare, A&M spent weeks altering the terms of her job. After hearing about the concerns, McElroy agreed to a five-year contract position without tenure, which would have avoided a review by regents. Last weekend, she received a third offer, this time with a one-year contract and emphasizing that the appointment was at will and that she could be terminated at any time.,She then turned the offer down.,McElroy’s hiring came under public scrutiny after the conservative website Texas Scorecard ,That website is the reporting arm of Empower Texans, a Tea Party-aligned group formed with millions in oil money. The organization holds huge sway over Texas Republican leaders.,And at least one known alumni association publicly acknowledged its concern over McElroy’s potential hiring.,The Rudder Association, an alumni network at Texas A&M, released a letter Friday that clarified the concerns it had with the potential hiring of McElroy.,“Upon learning of Dr. McElroy’s selection, TRA did express concerns to the administration, as did many others,” the letter stated. “TRA believes that a department head should embrace the egalitarian and merit-based traditions that characterize Texas A&M’s values rather than the divisive ideology of identity politics.”,The failed contract negotiations come at a time in Texas when public universities are under the microscope as a new state law that will go into effect in January bans offices, programs and training that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

36,"Top Texas A&M officials were involved in botched recruiting of journalism professor, who will receive $1 million settlement","Sign up for The Brief,Multiple Texas A&M University System regents voiced concerns about the perceived left-leaning credentials of Kathleen O. McElroy, a Black journalism professor, hired to launch a new journalism program at their flagship school, ,Top system leaders questioned the decision after a conservative website blasted the hiring of McElroy, a tenured professor at the University of Texas at Austin and a former New York Times editor. As Texas A&M University officials fielded pushback from regents and external concerns from conservative groups, McElroy’s offer was watered down after A&M held a public signing ceremony announcing her hire. She ultimately rescinded her acceptance.,A review of the failed hiring also revealed that former university President M. Katherine Banks was heavily involved in discussions about making changes to McElroy’s offer, contradicting Banks’ earlier claims that ,The report summarizing the internal inquiry, which was conducted by the system’s general counsel, included hundreds of pages of text messages and emails. It provides new insight into the unusual involvement of system-level regents, who are gubernatorial appointees, in a university-level hire. And it reveals that university leadership tried to delay the announcement of McElroy’s hiring until after the Republican-controlled Legislature ended this year’s regular lawmaking session and approved the system’s budget.,The report is the latest revelation as Texas A&M administrators grapple with two employment scandals that have rocked the Aggie community this summer and raised questions about the level of outside interference in university-level decisions that led to multiple resignations, including Banks. The system on Thursday also released details of an internal review of how respected opioids expert ,Both personnel controversies were first reported by The Texas Tribune.,The A&M system’s general counsel reported it could not find evidence that race and gender were a factor in the fumbled attempt to recruit McElroy. But the university also publicly acknowledged Thursday that it would pay a $1 million settlement to McElroy, who is remaining in her tenured role at UT-Austin.,McElroy, a 1981 Texas A&M graduate, has studied news media and race, with a focus on how to improve diversity and inclusion in newsrooms. A&M’s attempt to recruit her came as lawmakers were debating a bill that bans diversity, equity and inclusion offices, programs and training at publicly funded universities. That legislation ultimately passed and takes effect Jan. 1.,McElroy previously said that her appointment was caught up in “DEI hysteria” as Texas university leaders try to figure out what type of work involving race is allowed under the new law. She told the Tribune she felt judged for her race and gender and said an A&M administrator told her that her hire has raised concerns within the system because “you’re a Black woman who worked at The New York Times.”,Text messages and emails included in the report reveal that many members of the Board of Regents had concerns with McElroy’s prior experience, which they viewed as counter to the vision they had for the new journalism program and the university writ large.,“Please tell me this isn’t true,” regent Jay Graham wrote to Banks and Chancellor John Sharp about the news of McElroy’s hire. “But since it’s not April Fools Day, I assume it is. I thought the purpose of us starting a journalism program was to get high-quality Aggie journalist[s] with conservative values into the market. This won’t happen with someone like this leading the department.”,After the deal fell apart, Board of Regents Chair Bill Mahomes sent a letter to McElroy on July 19 stating that the Board of Regents “did not discourage your hiring” and would not question the hiring of an individual based on their race or gender.,But a month prior, on June 19, regent Mike Hernandez told Banks and Sharp in an email that “granting tenure to somebody with this background is going to be a difficult sell for many on the [board of regents],” and encouraged them to “put the brakes on this, so we can all discuss this further.”,“While it is wonderful for a successful Aggie to want to come back to Texas A&M to be a tenured professor and build something this important from scratch, we must look at her résumé and her statements made an[d] opinion pieces and public interviews,” Hernandez wrote. “The New York Times is one of the leading main stream media sources in our country. It is common knowledge that they are biased and progressive leaning. The same exact thing can be said about the university of Texas. Yet that is Dr. McElroy’s résumé in a nutshell.”,He added that he forwarded all information he could find about McElroy via an internet search to system general counsel Ray Bonilla to distribute to the full board.,The internal inquiry also shows that the effort to promote conservative values at A&M extended beyond the journalism program. Texts between Graham and regent David Baggett about McElroy’s hiring referenced Banks’ 2022 move to combine several academic programs into a new College of Arts and Sciences as part of a new strategic plan to reshape the university’s structure.,“Kathy [Banks] told us multiple times the reason we were going to combine arts and sciences together was to control the liberal nature that those professors brought to campus,” Graham wrote. “This won’t happen with this kind of hire.”,The general counsel report was released to the public days after the regents directed that office to conduct a “complete and thorough investigation” into what happened and gave university lawyers the green light to negotiate a settlement with McElroy.,In a joint statement from McElroy’s lawyer and the university announcing the settlement, A&M apologized to McElroy and acknowledged “mistakes were made” during the attempt to hire her.,“Texas A&M University remains in my heart despite the events of the past month,” McElroy said in the statement. “I will never forget that Aggies – students, faculty members, former students and staff – voiced support for me from many sectors. I hope the resolution of my matter will reinforce A&M’s allegiance to excellence in higher education and its commitment to academic freedom and journalism.”,In the weeks following the initial offer, McElroy told the Tribune, Texas A&M started to walk back its terms, reducing it from a tenured position to ultimately a one-year teaching contract and a three-year offer to serve as the director of the journalism program. McElroy told the Tribune that José Luis Bermúdez, the former interim dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, said that there were concerns from within the A&M system about her hiring because of her prior work to build diverse and inclusive newsrooms and her experience at The New York Times.,In early July, McElroy said that Bermúdez advised her to remain at UT-Austin in her tenured position because he could not protect her if outside forces wanted her gone. McElroy took that advice.,Texas A&M’s failed recruitment garnered national media attention and spurred outrage from faculty organizations and alumni groups demanding the school explain what happened.,“How this University treated this respected, honored, qualified, experienced, successful, and tenured fellow Aggie is unacceptable and would have been unthinkable yet for her race and gender,” leaders of the Black Former Student Network wrote to Sharp. “The fact that this University outwardly promotes very laudable principles in the Aggie Core Values, yet you don’t have the character nor the courage to follow these Core Values as the leader of this University reveals the deep chasm between your words and your actions.”,In a meeting with the Faculty Senate days after the news broke, Banks and other administrators said they were unaware of the changes made to the original offer letter.,“I am embarrassed that we are in a situation where we have an offer that was released without the proper approvals. I was surprised by that,” Banks said during the meeting. “However, it’s important to note that we honored that letter, we honored all of the letters, because it was of no fault to the candidate, who was very, very qualified, that our administrative structure broke down.”,But after the Faculty Senate meeting, Hart Blanton, the communications and journalism department head involved in the failed effort to recruit McElroy, said that Banks interfered in the hiring process and that race was a factor in university officials’ decision to water down McElroy’s job offer.,“To the contrary, President Banks injected herself into the process atypically and early on,” Blanton said.,Blanton said he shared “related materials” with university lawyers on July 21. Hours later, Banks submitted her resignation to Sharp, which was ,“Texas A&M cannot have its leaders misleading the faculty, public, or policymakers about how we conduct business,” Blanton said.,According to the report, Blanton made a verbal offer to McElroy on May 11 and she accepted.,In text messages on May 11 and 12, Bermúdez told Blanton that he had spoken with Banks and she preferred the university wait until after the legislative session concluded at the end of May before announcing the hire.,“Bottom line is that the NYT connection is poor optics during this particular legislative session,” Bermúdez said to Blanton.,During this time, state lawmakers were considering legislation to ban faculty tenure and eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion offices on college campuses. University leaders, including those at Texas A&M, were negotiating with lawmakers over the legislation, as well as state funding for public universities.,Thursday’s report shows that Blanton raised concerns about delaying the public announcement of McElroy’s hiring from the beginning, arguing in text messages it was bad optics to hire a Black professional but then ask them to not associate with the university while lawmakers were still making decisions about university funding.,Blanton suggested that the university bring in a “crisis communication team” because “there may be some possibility we make national news of the Nikole Hannah-Jones variety if we ask a famous Black journalist not to share her exciting decision with the world.”,Hannah-Jones spearheaded The New York Times’ ,According to Thursday’s report, McElroy was told the university was stalling her announcement due to administrative requirements.,After the regular legislative session ended, Banks alerted Sharp that they planned to move forward with the announcement. Sharp told Banks to alert Mahomes, the chair of the system’s Board of Regents.,Two days after McElroy’s June 13 signing ceremony, the conservative website Texas Scorecard published an article painting her as a “Diversity, Equity and Inclusion proponent.” The university received multiple phone calls from the Rudder Association and former students raising concerns about the hire. Banks also said she received calls from six to seven members of the Board of Regents asking questions.,“​​The regents had been briefed previously on the provisions of ,By June 19, Blanton and Bermúdez were negotiating with McElroy to accept a position without tenure. According to the text messages, McElroy was open to the idea. McElroy previously told the Tribune that Bermúdez had convinced her to forgo tenure and avoid the need for board approval.,According to a message that Bermúdez sent Banks, McElroy “is happy with the professor of the practice.” Texts show Bermúdez and Banks discussed a three-year contract, which Bermúdez sent to Banks to review, contradicting Banks’ claims to the Faculty Senate that she did not see copies of new offer letters. Banks gave the go-ahead to revise the offer, but when Bermúdez asked how much he could say about support from the top of the university, Banks replied, “Absolutely nothing. Nothing, nothing.”,“She is going to have a very rough road here,” she said.,On June 22, as Bermúdez and Blanton were texting about the new offer letter, Bermúdez told Blanton that he needed to communicate to McElroy that this was a high-stakes situation. He mentioned Avery Holton, a white male communications professor who had been offered the same position but withdrew for personal reasons.,“Somebody like Avery comes here and nobody cares. The board will be as interested as they are in the synchronized swimming team,” Bermúdez said. “Kathleen comes here and everybody takes note. That makes things volatile and high stress.”,On June 27, Banks approved the revised offer letters but told Bermúdez to wait until July 8 to move forward with sending them to McElroy. The report states that Mahomes requested the appointment be delayed until after the board could receive an update in its July 6 meeting.,“It’s going to be a little awkward,” Bermúdez replied to Banks. “I’ll need to think of what to say.”,The board discussed the McElroy hiring behind closed doors but took no action and did not direct Banks to change the offer terms. McElroy was expected to provide a briefing to the board on the new journalism program during its regular board meeting in August.,On July 7, Bermúdez, Blanton and McElroy had a phone call.,“Bermúdez does not recall his specific comments to McElroy, but Blanton and certain text messages indicate that Bermúdez did make a comment to McElroy during the phone call about race being a factor in her treatment,” the report states. “Bermúdez now explains that the comment referred to race potentially being a factor for certain outside parties that were critical of hiring McElroy and did not mean that race was a factor for any TAMU officials.”,On July 8, McElroy told Bermúdez she was cutting off contact with Texas A&M. When Bermúdez sent an updated offer letter to McElroy on July 9, it included a one-year appointment to teach and a three-year appointment to run the journalism program.,The report does not address the five-year offer letter McElroy was sent, which she provided to the Tribune.,On July 10, Bermúdez and McElroy spoke on the phone, and McElroy expressed displeasure that the faculty appointment was only for one year. Bermúdez said he would see what he could do.,McElroy decided to stay at UT-Austin and reached out to the Tribune. Text messages show Bermúdez alerted Banks that the Tribune reached out for comment about the botched negotiations.,“Ok,” Banks responded. “I assume all text messages were deleted.”,The day the Tribune’s initial story published, text messages show Banks and Bermúdez expressed anger that McElroy shared her story with the media.,“I think we dodged a bullet. She is a awful person to go to the press before us,” Banks said. “We will learn from this and move on ... Just think if she had accepted!!! Ugh.”,The general counsel report also includes ,In mere hours, Buckingham called Patrick, who called Sharp and asked him to investigate. Texas A&M previously said the request made its way down the chain of command to the university, where the Division of Risk, Ethics and Compliance placed Alonzo on leave while it investigated. UTMB issued a “formal censure” of Alonzo, though university leaders would not confirm what Alonzo was alleged to have said.,The case has also raised concerns about political interference in the university’s academic affairs.,The university said Alonzo did not object to how the investigation was handled.,On Wednesday, ,Alonzo denied those claims and said in a statement through Texas A&M University that her comments were “mischaracterized and misconstrued.”,“I’ve given this same presentation about 1,000 times across the state over the past few years, and I also have trained others to provide the same presentation,” Alonzo said. “At no time did I say anyone deserved to die from an overdose.”,Texas A&M’s review,Unlike the investigation into McElroy’s bungled hiring — which included hundreds of pages of documents — the review of Alonzo’s case included only a handful of pages of documents. The system also released a message Thursday from Sharp, in which he apologized to Alonzo.,“I am sorry her name was bandied about in the news media four months after the university had cleared her of allegations she had criticized Lt. Governor Dan Patrick in a manner that at least one student found offensive,” Sharp wrote in a statement.,Previously, Texas A&M officials had told the Tribune that Sharp asked a staffer to look into Alonzo’s comments and that staffer asked Banks to investigate. The report identifies Banks as the person who officially called for the investigation into Alonzo.,The university’s review confirmed the Tribune’s reporting that Patrick called Sharp, who asked university officials to look into the matter. It said Sharp later sent Patrick a message notifying him that an investigation was underway.,“Joy Alonzo has been placed on administrative leave pending investigation re firing her. shud be finished by end of week,” read the text, which was made public by the Tribune but not included in the university’s review.,In a statement Thursday, Sharp said the report also “corrects the false narrative that I ordered an investigation into Dr. Alonzo and am not a champion of academic freedom because I took one brief, non-threatening phone call from the lieutenant governor.”,Sharp said the university put Alonzo on leave while it investigated the allegation “with no initiation or interference from me.” He said the investigation was sparked by UTMB’s censure, which he said was done without providing Texas A&M any information and “unfortunately” still hasn’t been retracted.,“What else would you have the university do but check it out?” Sharp wrote.,Texas A&M University System spokesperson Laylan Copelin said in a statement that Sharp’s text to Patrick was a “typical update,” saying it is not unusual for the chancellor to “keep elected officials informed when something at Texas A&M might interest them.”,“It is not unusual to respond to any state official who has concerns about anything occurring at the Texas A&M System,” said Copelin, who said the system followed standard procedure to look into the claim.,But the Faculty Senate has sent a letter to Welsh, the interim president, demanding that the university clarify its administrative leave policies and ensure they are properly followed.,“From the faculty’s perspective, Professor Alonzo’s administrative leave appears to have been instigated on a hasty reaction that short-circuited reasonable due process under the circumstances,” Hammond wrote. “We want to work with you to avoid that kind of outcome in the future.”,The Texas A&M Faculty Senate is also investigating what happened in the situations involving McElroy and Alonzo. Earlier this week, it announced a three-person investigative subcommittee to examine both circumstances. It’s unclear what the timeline is for that investigation.,Overall, the two situations have left Texas A&M faculty uneasy over the potential chilling effect on speech — and the possible fostering of a fearful culture in which professors agonize over the political ramifications of their work.,It has also raised concerns about how these events have damaged the university’s reputation and could slow efforts to recruit and retain academic talent, eclipse decades of work, and erode the love and devotion that students, instructors and alumni have poured into a beloved institution.,In a press conference this week, ,“It’s really important for even great, great institutions to occasionally step back and take a real honest look in the mirror,” he said. “As soon as we get all the facts available to us, we need to make decisions on how we prevent getting into these situations in the future.”,William Melhado and James Barragán contributed to this story.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, New York Times, Texas A&M University System and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

It also comes as protests continue in Texas and nationwide over police brutality and systemic racism. At the A&M System's flagship campus in College Station, protests in particular have sprouted over the presence of a statue honoring Sul Ross, a former Texas governor and president of A&M who served as a general in the Confederate army.,A&M System Chancellor John Sharp said Monday that the fund had been ""in the works for some time."",""The goal ... is to make A&M system's 11 universities look like Texas,"" Sharp said.

39,Ken Paxton isn’t the only Texan fighting impeachment this week. Meet Texas A&M’s student body president.,"Sign up for The Brief,This week in Texas, there’s an elected official fighting impeachment proceedings stemming from accusations that he abused his government office.,Well, make that two elected officials fighting impeachment proceedings.,In College Station, about 100 miles away from the Texas Capitol, Hudson Kraus, the Texas A&M student body president, is in the midst of an impeachment that echoes the state’s historic trial of the state attorney general, ,Instead of the gray hair and expensive suits of the state Legislature, this impeachment was prompted by student senators hunched over laptops splattered with stickers and carrying backpacks full of homework.,Less than a month into the fall semester, the Texas A&M University student Senate,Kraus and multiple members of the student Senate did not respond to emails from The Texas Tribune. All members of the Texas A&M Student Government Association are currently under a gag order — just like the one Lt. Gov. ,The parallel impeachment proceedings — at two very different levels of government — highlight how the once obscure political tool to hold elected officials accountable for grave errors in judgment and malfeasance has become en vogue. The everyday proceedings may erode its effect, political experts say.,The student Senate was poised to hold the impeachment trial this week, but ,While the student trial offers many similarities to the goings on in Austin, ,Paxton, who was also student body president when he attended Baylor University, faces 16 articles of impeachment that accuse him of misusing his office to help Austin real estate investor Nate Paul, a friend and political donor who has been charged with eight counts of ,The suspended attorney general hasn’t attended his trial since the first day when he was required to appear as his lawyer pleaded not guilty on his behalf. Paxton has vehemently denied the accusations and his lawyers have vowed to present evidence showing the accusations are based on assumptions, not facts.,Historically, impeachment has been reserved as a nuclear option when other solutions to give a duly-elected official the boot have failed. However, the threat of impeachment has picked up steam in the last decade.,“It’s being seen now more as a common occurrence than a rare one,” said Brandon Rottinghaus, political science professor at the University of Houston. “Political opponents are looking for a way to ramp up their attacks on opponents, so using the institutional levers of government to do that is the next step.”,Over the last few years, Republicans and Democrats have made their fighting more public than ever before, and the rest of the country has watched like spectators at a boxing match. Smaller governments are taking notes, Rottinghaus said, and using practices like recall elections — or “little impeachments” — to get their way.,In one case out of Lubbock, former Council member Victor Hernandez was the subject of a,“These are small-scale politics, but they’re taking their cues from institutional friction,” Rottinghaus said.,The impeachments in Austin and College Station also come as U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, announced his support of an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden calling it the “logical next step” after months of probing by House Republicans into the Biden family.,Back in Texas, The Battalion reported the conflict in College Station started in late August. A student senator revealed that ,Last week, Kraus apologized to the student Senate privately.,“As family is incredibly important to me, I just wanted to try and protect my brother and see what was best for him to occur,” Kraus wrote in an apology letter published by The Battalion. “Unfortunately, I made inaccurate decisions that were not indicative of my character in trying to defend a member of my family.”,In the letter, which the Battalion reported that Kraus presented to senators on Sept. 8, Kraus pleaded with senators to reconsider impeachment, arguing he made a mistake that did not reflect a broader pattern of behavior.,But student senators demanded a public apology, The Battalion reported.,On Wednesday, just before the start of the trial, Kraus filed an appeal to the Judicial Court of Texas A&M. According to The Battalion, the request is made if someone believes there is an error in student government procedures.,Two-thirds of the student Senate must vote to impeach ,And in both cases, senators are taking the imposed gag order seriously.,“The court will be unable to release any statement prior to the trial in order to protect all parties that may be involved with the court,” Sawyer Bagley, chief justice of the student court at Texas A&M, wrote in a Sept. 13 statement to The Battalion. “We have a process we must follow, and this is part of it.”,At the start of the trial last week, state Sen. Drew Springer, R-Muenster, reminded his constituents he and his staff are prohibited from discussing the trial.,“As your Senator, I hold my constitutional duty as a member of the Court of Impeachment in the highest regard and will continue to honor my oath,” he wrote in a statement. “While I cannot discuss the impeachment trial, please know that my staff and I are here to assist you with all other matters.”,In Austin, the trial is wrapping up its second week. And closing arguments are expected to begin at 9 a.m. Friday.,At College Station, the student court gave each side 72 hours to prepare before they present evidence in the case “Student Body President Kraus v. Student Senate.” Both sides will present their case in front of the justices who will make a decision on the appeal, which will determine if the trial moves forward.,With impeachment continuing to waft in the political sphere, Rottinghaus said the constant threat may erode people’s faith in the process.,“Impeachment is something people, historically, hope to use as a last resort and in very specific circumstances,” Rottinghaus said. “If they are perceived to be just business as usual or a political weapon, it’ll cease to be effective.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and University of Houston have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

40,"Texas A&M asks lawmakers for $55 million in ""equity"" funds, citing UT's budget","While lawmakers try to revive a rivalry football game between the state’s flagship institutions, a different contest between the University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University began to play out Tuesday, when A&M’s president asked lawmakers for more than $50 million to bring the school’s per-student funding closer to UT’s.,In a Senate Finance Committee hearing in the bowels of the state Capitol, A&M President Michael Young requested “equity” funds of around $27.5 million a year, the same amount a preliminary state budget has earmarked for the Austin flagship.,“At the moment our challenge is, with our per-student funding going down, it will become very hard to sustain this,” Young said. The school might have to consider shrinking the student body of the university or making other accommodations based on the “resources that we have available,” he said.,In 2017, when most public colleges were threatened with funding cuts, UT was granted a $55 million “hold harmless” payment to ensure the school’s allocation was at least held flat. While colleges are not expected to face the same slashes this budget cycle, institutions that received hold harmless funding, like UT-Austin, had those line items maintained.,Young’s request for an equity adjustment might be a reference to the hold harmless money, which A&M did not receive last biennium. But the gap between A&M’s and UT’s per-student funding has grown over the last five years, due in large part to growing enrollment at the College Station campus.,While UT-Austin’s enrollment has hovered around 51,000 students in the last decade, A&M's has increased from about 48,000 to nearly 64,000, according to the state's Higher Education Coordinating Board. Under the proposed budget, UT would receive about $860 more per student from the state each year, Young said Tuesday, not including medical students — and the requested infusion of $55 million would close half that gap.,State Sen. ,Texas colleges receive most of their state money through a formula based largely on past years’ enrollment. The A&M System includes seven nonacademic state agencies, whose appropriations are not included in the calculation of per-student funding.,At one point during the hearing, John Sharp, chancellor of the A&M System said: “Something has to give there."",“Either we've got to come down in our enrollment pretty substantially or something has to change,"" he said.,Representatives of UT and several other public colleges,Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin and Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Katherine Banks, dean of the college of engineering at Texas A&M University, has been named the sole finalist for president of the flagship university based in College Station after a national search.,The Texas A&M Board of Regents approved Chancellor John Sharp’s recommendation at a board meeting Wednesday after four finalists were interviewed. Under state law, the board must wait 21 days before taking a final vote on the finalist.,If approved, Banks will become the second woman president in Texas A&M history after Elsa Murano, who served in the role from 2008 to 2009.,“This is a tremendous honor,” Banks said in a statement. “The core values of Texas A&M, its rich traditions, unique culture and commitment to the greater good is the very foundation of this great university and resonates deeply with me. I hope to build upon that framework in our pursuit of preeminence, without losing what makes Texas A&M so special. Texas A&M is one of a kind, and there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.”,Banks also oversees the Texas A&M System’s engineering programs. She came to the university in 2012 from Purdue University, where she was the Bowen Engineering head for the School of Civil Engineering. She’s also known for her extensive research and has authored or co-authored more than 150 journal articles.,""I'm drawn to universities that have a land-grant mission,"" she told The Bryan-College Station Eagle in 2012 after she was chosen to head the engineering school. ""The engagement with both the educational community and the broader community is very important to me."",When Banks started at Texas A&M, the engineering college had a little more than 11,000 students. Today, 21,250 students are enrolled. According to a Texas A&M system press release, Banks was instrumental in helping the system win a $2.5 billion management contract to run the Los Alamos National Laboratory with two other institutions.,Banks grew up in Whitesburg, Kentucky and received a bachelor’s in environmental engineering from the University of Florida in 1982. She earned her master’s from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and has a doctorate in civil and environmental engineering from Duke University.,Texas A&M started looking for a new president after Michael K.

42,Texas A&M president says she didn’t know about job offer changes that led to professor’s botched hiring,"Sign up for The Brief,Texas A&M President M. Katherine Banks told faculty on Wednesday she did not approve changes to an offer letter that led a prospective journalism professor to walk away from negotiations amid conservative backlash to her hiring.,“I am embarrassed that we are in a situation where we have an offer that was released without the proper approvals. I was surprised by that,” Banks said during a meeting of the university’s Faculty Senate. “However, it’s important to note that we honored that letter, we honored all of the letters, because it was of no fault to the candidate, who was very, very qualified, that our administrative structure broke down.”,Banks said the original offer made to Kathleen O. McElroy, a renowned journalist who was tapped to revive A&M’s journalism program, is still on the table. But when asked if the university’s administration had reached out to McElroy to again extend the offer, Banks said that the system’s Office of General Counsel recommended not doing so given the threat of legal action.,Vice President of Faculty Affairs N.K. Anand also said his office did not review the subsequent, watered-down offer letters sent to McElroy. Neither Banks nor Anand clarified where the diminished offer letters originated from or who approved them, but Anand said those decisions were made by the university’s department of Communication and Journalism within the College of Arts and Sciences.,McElroy could not be reached for comment Wednesday evening.,While Banks took responsibility for the botched hiring process, professors were left unsatisfied with the administration’s answers to questions about what exactly transpired over the weeks that led to McElroy walking away from the deal.,“We are a bunch of Ph.D.s right? And I don’t think that all of us can diagram what happened,” said Raymundo Arroyave, a materials science and engineering professor after the faculty’s hourslong meeting with Banks and Anand.,After talking to them, the Faculty Senate approved a resolution calling for the creation of a fact-finding committee to investigate the mishandling of McElroy’s hiring.,“We don’t know anything,” said María Moyna, a professor in the department of global languages. “Somebody or somebodies are at fault, and if people who were at fault aren’t punished, then things will continue to go like this.”,McElroy, a renowned journalism professor currently working at the University of Texas at Austin, turned down an offer to reboot A&M’s journalism program after a ,In the weeks after Texas A&M celebrated hiring McElroy, vocal groups from outside the university system expressed issues with her previous employment at The New York Times and her support for diversity in newsrooms. McElroy has said she was told that not everyone was pleased by her joining the faculty.,Just before she received the final offer letter, McElroy said she got a call from A&M’s interim dean for the College of Arts and Sciences, José Luis Bermúdez, warning her that there were people who could force leadership to fire her and he could not protect her. After the fiasco became public, Bermúdez announced he would ,One group that voiced concern to the administration about McElroy’s selection was The Rudder Association, a conservative alumni group that has previously ,In a statement issued Friday, the alumni group was critical of McElroy but rejected that its advocacy contributed to the university officials’ decision to scale back her job offer.,“TRA believes that a department head should embrace the egalitarian and merit-based traditions that characterize Texas A&M’s values rather than the divisive ideology of identity politics,” the alumni group said, referring to McElroy’s previous work to improve diversity in newsrooms.,During Wednesday’s meeting, Anand said no outside groups contacted him or his office regarding McElroy’s hiring. Banks said she met members of The Rudder Association at the beginning of her time as president roughly two years ago, but she has not met with the group since then.,Faculty said the perception of outside influence had significantly damaged the reputation of the university.,“[Recent] events have called into question the state of academic freedom at our university and created a national perception that outside influence has interfered in the appointment of Dr. Kathleen McElroy as a full professor with tenure at the university,” read the resolution the Faculty Senate adopted Wednesday.,The botched hiring comes as universities are facing scrutiny and resistance over their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Some conservatives have recently labeled programs and schools of thought that center the perspectives of people of color as “woke” ideologies that make white students feel guilty for the country’s history of racism.,Legislation,Sen. ,“I think that [McElroy’s] botched hiring … is a direct result of the hysteria concerning DEI, when the fact of the matter is she wasn’t being hired as a DEI official or an employee,” West told the Tribune. “She’s being hired to work with the journalism department.”,On Wednesday, administrators acknowledged that the flawed process would require changes. Anand said his signature will now be required — in addition to a dean’s and a department head’s — on all offer letters.,“I know that we will have to take steps and think very carefully about how we restore the confidence of individuals in Texas A&M and this administration,” Banks said.,A&M faculty’s criticisms of Banks and her handling of the botched hiring strained an already fraught relationship with her.,Last year, faculty leaders said Banks was ,Research leaders at the university also ,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, New York Times, University of Texas at Austin and ,Join us for conversations that matter with newly announced speakers at the ",19-Jul-23,Texas Tribune,0,0,sadness
43,Texas A&M’s early-voting location was popular during general elections before it was moved off campus,"Sign up for The Brief,When Brazos County officials removed an early-voting location off Texas A&M University’s campus — a decision that spurred ,But data shows it was one of the county’s most popular early-voting sites in recent general elections.,Commissioner Nancy Berry, who oversees the precinct that includes A&M, mentioned turnout at the Memorial Student Center as a supporting factor in moving the polling location to College Station City Hall for November’s midterms, ,According to Brazos County in-person voting data reviewed by The Texas Tribune, the MSC had the county’s second-highest number of early voters in the 2018 and 2020 general elections. The county’s data shows that the MSC received 56,439 early-voting ballots in 2018. The number fell during the pandemic in 2020 to 14,717 early votes, but this was in line with dips at all other polling locations in the county.,When asked about these figures, Berry told the Tribune that what she meant by turnout was the amount of voters compared to the number of people who attend the school. She said the concentration of people on campus should have brought more early voters to the polling location.,“When you think of 70,000 people that are right there and then you have another [120,000] that are spread throughout the county, and that’s not the highest voting site, even though you have that high population of people,” she said. “That was the point that it was a lower turnout number relative to the rest of the county.”,But Patrick Flavin, a political science professor at Baylor University, said the high number of people who cast ballots on campus in the previous general elections should justify using it again. Berry had stated that she would be in favor of bringing the MSC back for early voting next year.,And calculating voter turnout by early-voting location isn’t so straightforward.,In Brazos County, there is one polling location in each of the four precincts — plus one at the county elections administrator’s office — for,Flavin said that some students who voted could have cast ballots at other locations. And, he said, some voters who don’t attend A&M may have used the MSC as an early-voting location.,“To me, the raw numbers is a much more accurate test than based on how many people are in that area,” he said.,On the other hand, it’s true that votes cast at the MSC were among the fewest total early vote counts during the primary elections in 2022, 2020 and 2018. But Texas in general has historically seen ,For Samuel, whose nonpartisan group champions voter engagement, the lack of communication around such nuance was “extremely misleading.”,“They’re going to poke and grab any kind of evidence used to justify that decision when in reality, it was just not a well thought-out decision,” she said.,Beyond turnout, Berry has largely attributed the decision to move the location off campus to complaints from nonstudents who said navigating the campus was difficult. Since the original decision, officials have said eliminating the location was a mistake. County commissioners discussed the decision again last week, but ultimately ,Flavin said ,“Putting one on a college campus to me would make a lot of sense,” he said.,In the meantime, Samuel said MOVE Texas A&M is focusing on engaging students and ,“I hope all the students get registered and come vote,” Berry said. “It was a mistake and we’re trying to do the best we can to correct it within the means that we have possible.”,Disclosure: Baylor University, MOVE Texas and Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

The board must add the projects to the construction plan before moving forward with design and ultimately construction.,The board agreed to spend $85 million on a law and education building, which A&M officials expect to start building next year. Another $85 million was approved for a research and innovation center, which is scheduled to be built in 2024.,“Texas A&M is the future of Fort Worth,” said Mayor Mattie Parker. “This is truly the most transformational thing that will happen in Fort Worth that will continue into perpetuity.”,Dubbed “Aggieland North” by Texas A&M Chancellor John Sharp, the new campus will be next to the Texas A&M School of Law and will house a variety of research and education programs.,Sharp’s vision is 10 years in the making.,It’s where leaders of the system’s Institute for Advancing Health Through Agriculture hope to develop a new food pyramid for the country. Tarleton State University, about 70 miles southeast of Fort Worth, will relocate its health-related courses so students are closer to nearby hospitals and clinicals. The campus will also provide space for local companies to conduct workforce training.,Multiple state agencies, including the Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service, the Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station, Texas A&M AgriLife Research and the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, will have a presence on the new campus.,The Texas Division of Emergency Management is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency to potentially place a “disaster school” on the campus to train first responders and emergency response leaders from across the midwest in emergency preparedness and mitigation.,“This is going to be a presence built on the needs of Fort Worth,” Sharp said. “Whether that is defense contractors or whether that is a health science facility or whether it is engineering.”,A third building on campus, the Gateway Center, is also in the works to replace A&M’s current law school building, Texas Wesleyan University’s former law school building, which became Texas A&M School of Law in 2013. The new Gateway Center will house law school administrators and other rooms for use by the community.,The money for the two additional buildings in Fort Worth is part of a $1.5 billion package of newly approved projects that make up the system’s five-year, $4.2 billion capital plan across the system’s 11 universities and eight state agencies.,The idea to expand into Fort Worth began nearly two years ago when Fort Worth billionaire John Goff and former Mayor Betsy Price invited the Texas A&M system to expand its reach into the city and stimulate business growth downtown.,Goff told regents Thursday that Fort Worth is one of the largest cities in the country without a Tier 1 research presence.,According to A&M, about half of the 1.2 million adults in Tarrant County over the age of 25 do not have a college degree, and 1 in 4 households have an annual income lower than $30,000.,Texas A&M system leaders expect to bring a design for the new law and education building before the board next spring, which is the last step before the system can break ground.

There’s a sense of vibrancy and when you ask a question, people say, ‘Yes, we can do it,’” said Miranda, a neuroscience and experimental therapeutics professor. “There was a sense of optimism. And I bought into that.”,So began three decades of working for the university and preaching — at research symposiums, to anyone, anywhere, during any opportunity — about an institution he saw as a Texas gem.,That pride has recently dimmed.,Miranda and other faculty members described a sense of disappointment, sadness and concern this week about the future of their university following the ,The turmoil grew when the Tribune published another report Tuesday detailing a second instance in which school officials made employment decisions in ,Faculty expressed shock at the extent to which political pressures have interfered in a university whose values of integrity, respect and excellence appear to have been challenged. They’re uneasy over the scandals’ potential chilling effect on speech or the possible creation of a fearful environment in which professors agonize over the political ramifications of their work — leading some to consider looking for other jobs.,Most of all, they worry that the damage to the university’s reputation will slow efforts to recruit and retain academic talent, eclipse decades of work, and erode the love and devotion that students, instructors and alumni have poured into an institution they believe in.,“A&M is this great place and a wonderful place and I believe that is true. But when things like this happen,” Miranda said and paused. “It’s really hard to build. It’s easy to tear down.”,Miranda said he was speaking as an individual whose views did not represent those of the university.,The university’s efforts to hire Kathleen McElroy, an experienced journalist and professor, fell apart when the job offer was diluted from a tenure-track role to a one-year contract that could be terminated at any time. The dean involved in hiring her told her that her appointment had been caught up in “hysteria” over diversity initiatives in Texas. She told the Tribune the final offer “makes it clear they don’t want me there” and walked away from the negotiations.,In a tense Faculty Senate meeting after the publication of the Tribune’s story, Banks told the group that she ,Still, she and the dean ,“We were on top of the world. We had an international stage to announce what was going to be a premier journalism program — not just in the country but in the world — with one of the best-qualified candidates that could be imagined for this position,” said Nathan Crick, a professor in the department.,“The fall from that high to the absolute low of now being a department that was scapegoated by this administration and now represents the face of what is in effect a racist institution — at least in reputation — it is hard to imagine a greater distance to fall,” Crick continued. “We are feeling betrayed, demoralized, outraged.”,This week’s revelation,The investigation into opioid expert Joy Alonzo, who has taught college students in Texas for more than a decade, was kicked off by Texas Land Commissioner ,It is still not clear what exactly Alonzo said, though people who attended Alonzo’s lecture told the Tribune that she suggested Patrick’s office had opposed opioid policies that could save lives. Texas A&M eventually allowed Alonzo to keep her job; an internal investigation could not confirm any wrongdoing.,The Alonzo investigation was quickly blasted by freedom of expression organizations. ,“Texas A&M’s punishment of Alonzo to please powerful political forces is a stunning abdication of its constitutional obligations, deeply chilling faculty and student expression on campus,” FIRE said in ,In a statement last week responding to the McElroy scandal, Sharp told faculty that he shared their concerns about outside influence on hiring and promotion. The university’s Faculty Senate requested a meeting with Sharp after the Tribune reported on the Alonzo case.,“We find another case in which there is no longer the appearance, but actual evidence, of interference by outside political forces to erode the academic freedom of Texas A&M faculty to dialog with students on socially relevant topics in their area of expertise,” senate Speaker Tracy Hammond wrote in a letter to Sharp before the meeting. “This is not only having a chilling effect on our faculty but is further damaging the national reputation of our university. And it will make it even more difficult to recruit and retain the best and brightest talent.”,Sharp met privately with some Faculty Senate members Wednesday night.,Meanwhile, worries shared by two distinguished professors on a faculty listserv late last week show university staff remains on edge and tensions are high between faculty and administrators.,“Now the awful administration is gone, but fixing the huge damage done in the last two years to the work and reputation of the university looks like a Herculean task,” wrote Peter Kuchment, a mathematics professor. “I hope we can do this.”,Another faculty member, chemistry professor Karen Wooley, called for the resignation of N.K. Anand, vice president of faculty affairs, who said last week that his office had not reviewed the watered-down job offer letters sent to McElroy. Wooley previously confronted then-university president Banks and warned her in a letter last year that some of her decisions were causing “substantial disruptions and threatening the integrity of this prestigious and precious institution.” The letter ,Anand responded over the weekend, according to communications reviewed by the Tribune, that he would resign if he was found culpable of any wrongdoing involving McElroy’s hiring or otherwise.,But, he wrote, “if I am proven innocent, I demand that both Drs. Wooley and Kuchment resign as Texas A&M Faculty members effective immediately.”,Anand, who is from India, then suggested that he had been slandered and said he hoped there was no “racial animus” in the attacks against him. The high-ranking administrator signed off with an all-caps quote from Leo Tolstoy: “GOD SEES THE TRUTH BUT WAITS.”,Kuchment said in an email to the Tribune he had not named Anand in his note last week and had apologized for Anand’s apparent misunderstanding. In a followup email Monday, Wooley told Anand that she had not accused him of wrongdoing or questioned his character, adding that the offenses she referred to in the listserv were related to his professional performance.,“I have absolutely no information about what transpired or who was involved in the debacle surrounding Dr. McElroy’s hiring, and I would not accuse you or anyone of involvement,” Wooley wrote. “My primary interest is in identifying a pathway for our great institution to undergo rebuilding — please take an outside look and consider whether you remaining in the position as [vice president of faculty affairs] will help or hinder our ability to retain and recruit faculty, and to repair our reputation.”,It was apparently too late for Anand, who responded, “I do not accept your explanation of your post. Damage has been done.”,Anand referred a request for comment for this story to the university’s spokespeople.,Now faculty await the results of internal investigations into the McElroy case.,“To be completely fair we need to have the whole story: Why and how did this happen?” said John N. Stallone, past speaker of the Faculty Senate who’s been on the A&M faculty for 25 years in the department of physiology and pharmacology. “The fact that we can’t get the same story from two different people tells us the truth hasn’t been spoken yet.”,University leaders’ lack of transparency about how the scandals unfolded — and the persistent national attention — has deflated morale, according to professors who spoke candidly under the condition that their names not be published in any reports due to the sensitive nature of the situation.,One, a professor for almost a decade, said he has colleagues who have begun looking for other jobs. He was troubled by how much attention university leaders have paid to external political voices who are not authorities in the academic fields they are critiquing. Another professor said the university’s sense of purpose has dwindled as administrators’ energy has been focused on responding to the crisis.,Acting President Mark A. Welsh III tried to alleviate some of the concerns in a ,“Texas A&M has weathered many storms over its 147-year history, and we’ll weather this one,” Welsh wrote. “The quickest way to get past it is to walk side-by-side and recommit to showing the world what it means to be an Aggie. I’m looking forward to the journey.”,Miranda, the neuroscientist, said he still sees the energy of can-do-ism that first drew him to the school in his colleagues and students. That has kept him at A&M — when he’s received offers to leave, he just needed to look around him to decide he’d stay.,“If we can solve our problems and move on, A&M yet has the potential to be a really great institution, one that I believe in,” he said.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

They also argue that the cancellation violates students’ constitutional rights and a state law that broadly protects free speech on college campuses, potentially setting the university up for a lawsuit.,“Not only is this a gross and abhorrent comparison of two completely different topics, but it is also an extremely distorted and incorrect definition of drag as a culture and form of performance art,” students ,Students plan to protest every day this week on the campus in the small West Texas city of Canyon, ,“Drag is not dangerous or discriminatory, it is a celebration and expression of individuals,” student Signe Elder said in a statement. “Amidst the current climate of growing anti-trans and anti-drag rhetoric, we believe that it is important now more than ever to stand together and be heard.”,Elder is part of a group of students who have organized under the name Buffs for Drag, referring to the school’s buffalo mascot, to protest Wendler’s actions.,Drag shows frequently feature men dressing as women in exaggerated styles and have been a mainstay in the LGBTQ community for decades. Drag performers say their work is an expression of queer joy — and a form of constitutionally protected speech about societal gender norms.,But Wendler said drag shows “stereotype women in cartoon-like extremes for the amusement of others and discriminate against womanhood” in a Monday letter that was first obtained by ,“Forward-thinking women and men have worked together for nearly two centuries to eliminate sexism,” Wendler wrote. “Women have fought valiantly, seeking equality in the voting booth, marketplace and court of public opinion. No one should claim a right to contribute to women’s suffering via a slapstick sideshow that erodes the worth of women.”,His comments and decision to cancel the campus drag show come amid surging uproar over the lively entertainment as ,Republican Texas lawmakers have also homed in on the performances with a handful of bills that would regulate or restrict drag shows, including some legislation that would classify any venue that hosts a drag show as a sexually oriented business, regardless of the show’s content. On Thursday, a Senate committee will debate a scaled-back bill that would impose a $10,000 fine on business owners who host drag shows in front of children — if those performances are sexually oriented. The bill defines a sexually oriented performance as one in which someone is naked or in drag and “appeals to the prurient interest in sex.”,Rachel Hill, government affairs director for LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Texas, said drag doesn’t mock women. Instead, she said, it’s an art form that allows performers to explore their gender expression and take back power from what she said can be stifling gender norms.,“Drag has always been a way for people who don’t easily fit into the gender binary to embrace different facets of themselves,” Hill said in a statement to The Texas Tribune. “Womanhood comes in all shapes and sizes and is what we make of it. That’s what makes drag so powerful.”,West Texas A&M student groups were organizing the drag show, called “A Fool’s Drag Race,” for months. The LGBTQ student group Spectrum advertised the show on its Instagram page, encouraging people to sign up to perform.,Wendler argued in his letter that the West Texas A&M drag show goes against the U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s purpose, saying it’s inappropriate even if drag shows are not illegal.,A lawyer for the national campus free speech group Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression rejected that argument as “nonsense.”,“The only prejudice in play here is his,” said lawyer Alex Morey, arguing that Wendler has violated state and federal law by canceling the show.,In a statement to The Texas Tribune, Morey said that performances on campus such as drag shows are protected by the First Amendment.,“By unilaterally canceling the event because he personally disapproves of the views it might express, WTAMU’s president appears to have violated both his constitutional obligations and state law,” Morey said. “It’s really surprising how open he is about knowingly violating the law, especially because government officials who violate clearly established First Amendment law will not retain qualified immunity and can be held personally liable for monetary damages.”,The students who started the petition also accused Wendler of violating university policy, ,In 2019, Texas lawmakers passed a law that required universities to allow any person to engage in free-speech activities on campuses. The law passed with broad bipartisan support.,A West Texas A&M spokesperson said Tuesday morning that Wendler did not have any further comments. The Texas A&M University System, which oversees West Texas A&M, also declined to comment.,This is not the first time Wendler has been criticized for his comments related to people in the LGBTQ community. ,Last year, Texas A&M University in College Station drew criticism from students when the office of student affairs announced it would no longer sponsor Draggieland, the annual drag show competition that started in 2020. Students held the performance last year after raising money through private donations.

The system’s ethics and compliance office will oversee the implementation of the law and receive guidance from its general counsel as situations or questions arise.,In a list of,Senate Bill 17, ,In a message sent to faculty, staff and students earlier this month, Texas A&M University Interim President Mark Welsh III said the school will change its hiring practices and training, dissolve its office for diversity and seek other revisions to university policies.,Other state universities have taken similar steps.,The University of Texas System halted all DEI policies in February and required all universities under the system to develop policies to discipline employees or contractors who break the law. The University of Houston System Chancellor Renu Khator announced in June ,Jim Klein, former president of the Texas Association of College Teachers, said higher education leaders around the state may be interpreting the law differently from one another, with some providing more strict guidelines than others. The law, only seven pages long, leaves some rules up for interpretation, he said.,“My concern now is that I want to make … sure that everybody understands what the law actually says [and] what it doesn't say,” Shields said. “There can be a temptation, by some, to try to overreach and say that this should also be applied to instruction.”,To continue to receive state funding, Texas universities must comply with the ban’s requirements. This includes annual reporting to the ,To ensure compliance with the law, the Texas A&M University System said disciplinary action may be taken against employees or contractors who violate the law. Individuals can report violations to the system’s Ethic Points reporting system.,Student organizations — including those involved in DEI initiatives — are exempt from the law and universities may still provide funds, support and facilities to them.,“It is important to remember that nothing in SB 17 alters our existing obligations under federal and state law, including the anti-discrimination requirements of Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,” the system’s guidance says. “We must continue to ensure that our programs and activities are open and available to all persons on a non-discriminatory basis.”,Concerns about attracting legislators’ ire over the DEI ban came to a head at A&M earlier this year when the university ,McElroy previously said that her appointment was caught up in “DEI hysteria” as Texas university leaders try to figure out what type of work involving race is allowed under the new law.

This year, however, the county commissioners put the location up to a vote. With a simple majority, it was decided that the location would be moved to the newly constructed City Hall right in the center of College Station.,County Commissioner Nancy Berry, who oversees the precinct that includes Texas A&M, cited the convenient location of the City Hall as well as low voter turnout at the Texas A&M polling place as reasons for moving the early voting location.

49,Suspended Texas A&M professor denies saying Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick believes overdose victims “deserve to die”,"Sign up for The Brief,The Texas A&M University professor ,The Texas Tribune reported last week that Texas A&M temporarily suspended Joy Alonzo, a respected opioids expert, after Patrick learned about the alleged comments against him and asked Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp to investigate. The case has raised concerns about political interference in the university’s academic affairs.,Alonzo issued a statement denying the accusation hours after Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham, who initiated the complaint, discussed Alonzo’s alleged comments on social media for the first time.,On Wednesday, hours after ,In 2022, there were ,Buckingham declined multiple requests for comment before the Tribune published its initial story last week. University officials, Alonzo and Patrick have refused to specify what Alonzo was accused of saying during the March lecture.,In a statement provided by the university Wednesday, Alonzo responded, “A comment I made during a 2-hour lecture on March 7 regarding opioid overdose education and naloxone administration was mischaracterized and misconstrued. I’ve given this same presentation about 1,000 times across the state over the past few years, and I also have trained others to provide the same presentation. At no time did I say anyone deserved to die from an overdose.”,Buckingham did not hear Alonzo’s comments directly, but her daughter, who is a medical student at the University of Texas Medical Branch, attended Alonzo’s March lecture. Buckingham then alerted Patrick, who called Sharp and asked him to look into Alonzo’s comments.,Patrick’s op-ed confirmed the ,“I would do this on behalf of any student or parent who called our office with a similar complaint,” he added.,Patrick characterized the statement that Alonzo allegedly made as a “false and inappropriate personal attack on me” but did not specify what she actually said. Neither UTMB nor Texas A&M has confirmed what Alonzo said that prompted such a reaction from university officials. UTMB students interviewed by the Tribune recalled a vague reference to Patrick’s office but nothing specific.,Ultimately, Texas A&M allowed Alonzo to keep her job after an internal investigation could not confirm she had done anything wrong. In the statement provided by Texas A&M on Wednesday, Alonzo said she agreed to go on administrative leave and was satisfied with the outcome, which she said “exonerated me of wrongdoing.”,At a press conference Wednesday in College Station, interim Texas A&M President Mark Welsh III defended the university’s handling of the Alonzo investigation but said clear policies need to be in place to guide administrators on how to handle these situations in the future.,The university’s decision to place Alonzo on administrative leave with pay while it investigated the allegations sparked outcry from free-speech advocates and faculty who have described the situation as a case of political interference and a violation of professors’ academic freedom, which presumes faculty are protected under the First Amendment to speak freely about their subject matter expertise without fear of retaliation. Academic freedom has been a longstanding principle within higher education in the United States for more than a century.,The reaction to Alonzo’s situation comes as Texas A&M also faces criticism from faculty and alumni after the Tribune reported on the ,McElroy told the Tribune that the university watered down its offer from a tenured position to a one-year contract after she was told that people in the system were concerned about hiring her because she was Black and used to work at The New York Times. Outside groups also raised concerns about her diversity, equity and inclusion work. Some university administrators have resigned in the aftermath, including ,Within hours of Alonzo’s lecture in March, course leaders at UTMB also sent an email to students in the class saying Alonzo’s comments “about Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick and his role in the opioid crisis” did not represent the opinion of the university. The email also included a “formal censure” of Alonzo.,UTMB declined to comment on its decision to issue a censure, and Alonzo, whose job was at risk during the investigation, has declined to be interviewed.,Patrick said he accepted the outcome of A&M’s investigation but criticized faculty members for their “ongoing outrage” at the situation.,“Every student, parent, university booster, regent, chancellor, school president or legislator has the right to ask a question about campus conduct,” Patrick wrote. “Professors, who are largely funded by Texas taxpayers and students, are not above being held accountable.”,“Campus employees who coach sports understand what being held accountable means. A losing record will draw questions and criticism, often leading to their termination. Sports and academics are different, but all should be subject to a level of accountability,” he added.,Adam Steinbaugh, an attorney with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit legal group focused on protecting free speech on college campuses, said Patrick is correct that faculty can be criticized but added, “This was not criticism.”,“This was a senior government official with his government chief of staff putting pressure on a university leader to look into one of his critics,” Steinbaugh said. “Faculty members have a First Amendment right to criticize policies and officials, and officials should not be leaning on university leaders to look into their critics.”,The Academic Freedom Alliance, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting the rights of faculty members at colleges and universities across the country, said in a letter last week that Texas A&M’s decision to act on Patrick’s request without any due diligence is problematic.,“Instead the university preferred to shoot first and ask questions later in order to mollify the sensibilities of powerful government officials,” said Keith Whittington, founding chair of the Academic Freedom Alliance. “Such actions are completely inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom that ought to be respected at a serious university, and they suggest that the university would prefer to sacrifice the constitutional rights of members of the faculty rather than risk angering state politicians.”,The Texas A&M Faculty Senate did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Patrick’s op-ed.,Earlier this week, the Faculty Senate executive committee announced that it created an investigative subcommittee to “examine the circumstances surrounding the failed hiring of [Kathleen] McElroy and the suspension of [Joy] Alonzo.” The committee will produce a report detailing what happened and provide recommendations to “avoid similar actual or apparent challenges to academic freedom going forward.”,In the statement provided by A&M on Wednesday, Alonzo also touted the work she has done at the university to combat the opioid epidemic, including the creation of the university’s Opioid Task Force, which she co-chairs, and the development of a program to teach the public about opioid overdoses and how to reverse them using the opioid-reversing drug naloxone.,Through her work, Alonzo said, more than 45,000 people have been trained to recognize opioid overdoses and try to reverse them. She said the university’s Opioid Task Force has documented more than 200 overdose reversals.,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, New York Times, Texas A&M University System and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

50,"In lawsuit, UT-Austin professor accuses Texas A&M faculty program of discriminating against white and Asian men","Sign up for The Brief,A University of Texas at Austin professor has sued Texas A&M University claiming a new faculty fellowship program designed to increase diversity at the flagship university in College Station discriminates against white and Asian male candidates.,Richard Lowery, a finance professor at UT-Austin who is white, filed the federal class-action lawsuit on Saturday against the Texas A&M University System and its board of regents; Annie McGowan, Texas A&M’s vice president and associate provost for diversity; and N.K. Anand, Texas A&M’s vice president for faculty affairs.,Lowery is represented by America First Legal — a group created by Stephen Miller, a policy adviser for former President Donald Trump, and Jonathan Mitchell, a former solicitor general for Texas and the legal architect of the state’s six-week abortion ban.,In the lawsuit, Lowery claims that a new fellowship program ,While the ACES program focuses on hiring recently graduated doctoral students who want to enter academia, the new ACES Plus Program focuses on “mid-career and senior tenure-track hires from underrepresented minority groups, that contribute to moving the structural composition of our faculty towards parity with that of the State of Texas.” It sets aside $2 million over the next two fiscal years to help match a fellow’s base salary and benefits, up to a maximum of $100,000.,According to Texas A&M’s announcement of the new fellowship program on July 8, the university identified underrepresented groups as African Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives and Native Hawaiians.,“Texas A&M’s proclaimed goal of establishing a faculty whose racial composition attains ‘parity with that of the state of Texas’ seeks to achieve racial balancing, which is flatly illegal under Title VI and the binding precedent of the Supreme Court,” the lawsuit argues.,The lawsuit also accuses Texas A&M of setting aside faculty positions specifically for “underrepresented” racial groups. It points to an August email sent by an unnamed business professor to the head of the recruiting committee for the department of finance, Shane A. Johnson.,“I heard from someone that one of our lines is reserved for an ‘underrepresented minority.’ Is that correct?” the email read, according to a copy included as an exhibit in the lawsuit. Johnson replied later that day, “The underrepresented line would potentially be a third position, so yes reserved, but not one of our ‘regular’ positions.”,The lawsuit says, “Professor Lowery sues on behalf of a class of all white and Asian men who stand ‘able and ready’ to apply for faculty appointments at Texas A&M.”,In a statement, Texas A&M system spokesperson Laylan Copelin called the legal filing an “unusual job application when Mr. Lowery says in the lawsuit he is ‘able and ready’ to apply for a faculty appointment at Texas A&M. But our lawyers will review the lawsuit, confer with Texas A&M and take appropriate action as warranted.”,During the fall 2021 semester, 2,658 out of a total of 4,869 faculty were white, while 180 faculty members were Black and 335 faculty members were Hispanic, ,According to Texas A&M’s ,On its webpage for the larger ACES program, Texas A&M encourages “women, minorities, and members of other underrepresented groups” to apply and says they will be actively sought.,Lowery has been at UT-Austin since 2009.

51,Texas A&M System makes plans for how to handle in-person instruction this fall,"Next fall, Texas A&M students may be assigned which days they're allowed to go to class and which days class they'll be asked to stay home and follow class along from their laptops. If there are 50 people in a math class, for example, half of them will be allowed to show up Tuesday while the other half views online. On Thursday, the students would swap places.,This is just one of the measures in a plan Texas A&M University System officials approved Friday in an effort to create social distance in traditionally crowded classrooms. The guidance will apply across the board to each of the system's 11 institutions. A&M is the first major university system in the state to formally adopt plans for the fall, though officials warned there is much more work to be done before classes begin in August.,The University of Texas at Austin, meanwhile, has announced that on-campus classes will run from August to Thanksgiving and then continue remotely in an effort to limit student travel. The University of Texas System has not yet released concrete guidance on how classes and other activities will proceed at its 14 institutions.,While some face-to-face classes will resume at A&M, many will be conducted in a hybrid model mixing in-person and online instruction. Certain courses will be prioritized for in-person instruction, such as speech, performance and clinical classes.,Officials are also ,""All courses must be designed to shift to a remote environment if the conditions warrant,"" said James Hallmark, the vice chancellor for academic affairs for the A&M System. ""If indeed a second wave hits in the fall ... our courses will be designed from the start to [transition] with less disruption."",Hallmark said all meeting spaces, including classrooms, will sharply curtail capacity. For example, a room that typically would accommodate 50 people will instead only allow 15 people at a time. Physical adjustments will be made, such as installing plexiglass separators or other distancing aids.,Residence halls will be open, with students expected to maintain social distancing as much as possible. Students will be discouraged from traveling away from campus, as well as inviting overnight and out-of-town guests. If they do leave campus, they must self-report any exposure to COVID-19 and may need to self-isolate afterwards. There will be designated spaces in residence halls for students to use as they quarantine themselves.,While ,The plan emphasizes flexibility across each of the school system's 11 campuses, with each university tailoring specific accommodations to its region.

He also asked agencies to review noncontractual engagements with Russian entities.,“Please note that this action is in no way an indictment of our faculty members of Russian descent nor a criticism of faculty working to improve conditions in Russia, especially for oppressed groups in that country,” Sharp wrote. “I believe most, if not all, of our faculty oppose the aggression of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his cronies, and will support this action.”,According to the memo, agreements between the school and Russia could include student and faculty exchange programs and study abroad programs. But also included are any research-related agreements that involve clinical trials, testing, data use agreements and licensing agreements.,System leaders said there are fewer than 10 research agreements across the system and they do not believe the move will have a significant impact on its 11 individual universities, eight state agencies and RELLIS, A&M's research campus in Bryan. The system did not immediately respond to a request for those individual agreements.

56,"Following backlash, Texas A&M overhauls its sexual misconduct policies","* This story has been updated with additional comment. ,Responding to backlash over how its flagship campus handles sexual assault allegations, officials in the Texas A&M University System have embraced a wholesale overhaul of the disciplinary process, unveiling Monday mandatory sanctions for students and faculty that go so far as to require the automatic firing of any employee found responsible for sexual harassment.,The new regulations, which take effect immediately, ban faculty and staff from having consensual relationships with undergraduate students at A&M System schools and mandate that employees be terminated if found responsible for making sexual advances that are unwelcome, persistent and pervasive enough to constitute harassment.,Spurred in part by the #MeToo movement, which brought into the mainstream a conversation about harassment within institutions, colleges across the country have faced recent scrutiny for levying what critics deem to be lenient and inconsistent responses to campus misconduct.,Officials at the flagship campus, who announced Monday a battery of changes to their own student disciplinary processes, came under fire in June when a female student denounced ,On Monday, A&M President Michael Young said students on the College Station campus will now face tougher sanctions for sexual misconduct and that some discretion will be removed from the punishment process. Outlining nearly a dozen changes the school will immediately make, Young detailed initiatives often called for by victims' rights advocates, including an increase in the accessibility of counselors; having one case manager handle each grievance rather than a rotation of staff members; and requiring that transcripts be marked when a student has been suspended, dismissed or expelled in connection to misconduct.,A new system will also be established to decide if student-athletes and students who particulate in campus activities such as Greek life or the Corps of Cadets will be allowed to return after being found responsible for a violation of Title IX, the federal gender equity law. The dean of students, rather than a coach or organization leader, will now be arbiter on what interim restrictions are imposed on an accused student.,A&M System Chancellor John Sharp said in a statement Monday that the changes at A&M, which deal only with student conduct, would be extended to the system's 10 other campuses.,The recommendations are the result of two reviews Young commissioned in June, a week after the female student, Hannah Shaw, posted on Twitter. The student-athlete found responsible for sexually abusing her has since ,The product of the reviews, a 23-page report issued by the Husch Blackwell law firm and a 32-page presentation from an internal task force, were both released publicly. Young formed two additional committees Monday, one to review the new changes for students and a second to consider how to overhaul the sanctions imposed on faculty members and staff.,“This is and always will be a continuous process,"" Young said in a statement. ""The advocacy group that came forward gave us a chance to delve deeper, to listen to people who have engaged in this process. Their input has given us critical information to help make improvements.”,In past years, sexual misconduct cases involving student athletes have garnered outrage in Texas and across the country, where critics have at times decried college coaches or administrators for turning a blind eye to the transgressions of athletes or enabling a culture permissive of misconduct.,At other campuses, sexual misconduct from faculty members — and how to sanction those with tenure — has become an increasingly prominent and fractious issue.,Julie Harlin, speaker of the faculty senate at A&M, said she generally agrees with the goal of the system's new regulations, but that the key will be how they are implemented.,“The spirit is that we are trying to be more transparent about how we protect those that are in our institutions,” she said. “Where it gets dirty is in the details.”,Under Education Secretary Betsy Devos, the federal government has appeared to curtail its enforcement of Title IX, and rescinded Obama-era guidance that dictated how colleges should respond to sexual assaults on campus. At the time, around 2017, some administrators wondered if campuses would continue to pursue all misconduct allegations without the hammer of aggressive federal enforcement. But it seems most colleges have maintained their policies or ramped them up, at times under pressure from lawsuits, social media campaigns or the threat of bad publicity.,“The public attitude has been shifting very radically on this,” said Peter Lake, director of the Center for Excellence in Higher Education Law and Policy at Stetson University.,Nationally, policies mandating termination are “still gaining traction” because many schools want to “preserve the right to be flexible,” Lake said. But bans on consensual relationships between employees and undergraduates, and the imposition of minimum sanctions have become more common.,“Anybody that does criminal work knows that mandatory sentencing sometimes leads to nullification,” or that those minimum punishments are not doled out at all for fear they are overly-punitive. That thinking “presumes that those mandatory minimums are too stringent, and I don't know that they are,” Lake said.,A&M, he added, “may have caught a cultural moment."",Disclosure: The Texas A&M University System and Texas A&M University have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Texas became the second state in the country behind Florida to ban such offices and programs that are meant to help students from all backgrounds succeed on campus and can also boost diversity of its faculty.,DEI efforts became a popular way for university leaders to create more inclusive working and learning environments for students and faculty from underrepresented backgrounds, including people of different races or ethnicities, military veterans or people with disabilities.,In the letter, system leaders cast a wide net in their request for information, instructing university presidents to provide “documents and information” about all diversity programs, trainings and initiatives that are provided by the university’s DEI office or by a specific college or academic department. University leaders must provide details on all programs that “promote different treatment of, or provide special benefits to, persons due to their race, color or ethnicity, if any.”,The memo also asks for a list of faculty organizations that support faculty of a particular gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation as well as any employee and student handbooks, mission statements or media communications that focus on DEI efforts.,The memo asks that universities provide details on the source of funding for each program, initiative, training or campus organization. Universities must provide the information to the system by June 30.,System spokesperson Laylan Copelin said a system working group is gathering information as it reviews the law and developing a plan for implementation.,DEI offices often coordinate mentorships, tutoring and programs to boost people from underrepresented groups in fields like science and engineering. They help departments search widely for job candidates and ensure that universities don’t violate federal discrimination laws.,Critics accuse DEI programs of pushing what they characterize as left-wing ideology onto students and faculty and say that these programs prioritize social justice over merit and achievement.,SB 17, which Abbott signed one day after this letter was written, says universities cannot create diversity offices, hire employees to conduct DEI work or require any DEI training as a condition for being hired by or admitted to the university. All hiring practices must be “color-blind and sex-neutral.”,The bill would also prohibit universities from asking job candidates to provide written answers about how they consider diversity in their work or sharing how they would work with diverse populations, commonly known as diversity statements. Critics have equated diversity statements with ideological oaths, while supporters say they help ensure job candidates are prepared to support students from all backgrounds.,The legislation would not affect course instruction, faculty research, student organizations, guest speakers, data collection or admissions.,It does include language saying that if a federal granting agency or accreditation agency requires DEI programs, a Texas university or employee can instead submit a statement that highlights the school’s work helping first-generation college students, low-income students or underserved student populations.,In the memo, Texas A&M System leaders said university presidents should note if they believe any “trainings/activities/presentations” that refer to race, color, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation are required to comply with state or federal law or to maintain accreditation, or if they are required “for the purposes of enrollment or to perform any institutional function by an employee.”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

58,"For Black Aggies, questions over professor’s botched hiring persist after president’s departure","Sign up for The Brief,For Texas A&M University’s Black students and alumni, Friday’s sudden resignation of university President M. Katherine Banks after the botched hiring of a distinguished Black professor was an imperfect response that failed to answer a crucial question: Was the whole debacle caused by university administrators’ anxieties over diversity?,Banks left her post amid a whirlwind of backlash for how the university handled the recruiting of University of Texas at Austin professor Kathleen O. McElroy to revive Texas A&M’s journalism program.,McElroy, a 1981 Texas A&M graduate and the former director of the UT School of Journalism in Austin, rejected the A&M job after the offer was watered down twice, bringing it from a tenured position to a one-year job from which she could be fired at any point. The changes came after conservative groups took issue with her previous employment at The New York Times and her work in diversifying newsrooms.,“It’s a disservice when we make what was supposed to be something good a bad thing,” said Matthew Francis Jr., a fifth-year Texas A&M student who is pursuing a master’s degree in public service and administration. “Now Black students are left without representation of someone who has the experience of a faculty member that cares about what she does and someone who genuinely loves her field.”,A&M students also emphasized concerns about new state laws aimed at curbing the types of efforts McElroy had leveraged to improve newsroom diversity during her decadeslong career.,In a Friday message to The Texas Tribune, McElroy said, “I’m deeply grateful for the groundswell of support I’ve received, especially from Aggies of all majors, and my former and current students. There’s much more I could say and will say about what has unfolded. But for now, I’ll reserve those statements for a future date.”,Banks’ resignation, the ,Hours after Banks resigned, Hart Blanton, who leads A&M’s department of communications and journalism and was closely involved in McElroy’s recruiting, said ,“The unusual level of scrutiny being given to the hiring of Dr. McElroy was acknowledged by one administrator to have been based, at least in part, on race,"" he said in a statement. ""Regardless of the source of any such pressure, I understand it to be illegal for any employer—much less a public university—to subject a job candidate to stricter scrutiny due to her race or color."",Blanton also said Banks had misled faculty when she told them the decision to change McElroy’s job offer was made without her involvement.,“To the contrary, President Banks injected herself into the process atypically and early on,” Blanton said.,Laylan Copelin, vice chancellor for marketing and communication for the Texas A&M University System, said in a statement Friday that system officials had “read, heard and understood the concerns of our Aggie community” regarding McElroy’s failed hiring, which was being investigated by their legal team.,For Erica Davis Rouse, the president-elect of the A&M Black Former Students Network, it’s unclear what Banks’ departure was supposed to correct.,“If she’s resigning because she’s accepting the responsibility for what happened under her leadership, that’s probably the right thing to do,” she said. “But if she’s resigning because she accepted responsibility and now she’s being forced to resign, that’s not OK.”,Davis Rouse said the university’s actions further sow distrust between A&M and Black Aggies that has been simmering close to the surface in recent years.,She pointed to the debate over the statue of Lawrence Sullivan Ross, a former university president who was a Confederate general. The university declined to take down the statue after students demanded its removal based on its ties to historical violence. Davis Rouse said the chapter reflects a broader conflict between what some view as “traditional” Aggie values and university stances that don’t make students of color feel safe on campus, where only 3% of students are Black.,“In spite of everything that has happened over the years, I’ve been here, I still love my school,” Francis told the Tribune. “But I need people to understand that you can love something and want better for it at the same time.”,Davis Rouse said it can be frustrating trying to effect change, noting that the relationship Black students and alumni have with A&M is complicated. As the leader of an alumni organization, she’s acutely aware of which groups have — and don’t have — influence in the university system. A big part of that is money, she said.,“When the first Black students were able to go to A&M, there were already generations of white students that were far ahead of us, and those people were already giving before we were even able to be admitted to the university,” Davis Rouse said. “We just don’t have the voice from a financial perspective.”,McElroy’s failed hiring also raised concerns about a potential connection with Republicans’ recent attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. Public universities’ DEI offices will soon become a thing of the past when a ,Gary Bledsoe, president of the Texas NAACP, said in a statement that priorities in higher education have shifted.,“Education of students is no longer a primary consideration,” he said. “That lofty goal has been replaced by a political, anti-Black, anti-Brown and anti-education agenda.”,State Rep. ,“We thought we had a very productive meeting. We cleared the air. She didn’t try to make excuses,” Reynolds said. “We were fairly optimistic that we were going to have a follow-up with President Banks to discuss ways to move forward.”,Reynolds said her resignation was “somewhat of a surprise” and left things feeling unresolved.,“It’s a disappointment, I guess, that she’s being used as a scapegoat. I think there should be some accountability,” he said, adding that anyone who was involved in the process deserves scrutiny. “One of the things that the Legislative Black Caucus was seeking was accountability and more answers as to ‘Why did this happen the way it happened?’”,Disclosure: Texas A&M University, New York Times, Texas A&M University System and University of Texas at Austin have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

59,West Texas A&M University President Walter Wendler faces no-confidence vote from faculty after canceling drag show,"Sign up for The Brief,West Texas A&M University faculty leaders have called for a vote of no confidence this week to condemn President Walter Wendler less than a month after he came under fire from students and free speech groups for ,In a resolution obtained by The Texas Tribune, faculty senate leaders accused Wendler of abusing his role as president by running the university based on his own religious ideology. They said he has exhibited a pattern of “divisive misogynistic, homophobic and non-inclusive rhetoric that stands in stark contrast with the Core Values of the university.”,They also argued that Wendler has presented his personal opinions and religious beliefs in online blog posts as the official position of the university. Faculty leaders said those opinions go against the university’s mission, violate state and federal law, damage the university’s reputation and hurt fundraising efforts.,“We do not take this step lightly,” Ashley Pinkham, faculty senate president, wrote in a letter to all professors Monday announcing the vote. “However, we believe that the mission to provide intellectually challenging, critically reflective, and inclusive academic programs at a well-respected, high-quality institution of higher education is at jeopardy. We believe we must act now to restore the reputation of West Texas A&M University.”,The vote started Monday morning and will go through Friday afternoon. A university spokesperson confirmed the vote is in progress but declined to comment. The no-confidence vote is nonbinding and largely symbolic, but faculty hope it will send a message to the Texas A&M System Board of Regents and Chancellor John Sharp.,In a letter to the campus community last month, Wendler canceled a student drag show fundraiser and drew criticism from students when he argued that the performances are “derisive, divisive and demoralizing misogyny.”,Student leaders in a campus LGBTQ group ,Federal Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk denied the students’ request to immediately reinstate the student event. The case is still pending. Sharp declined to comment on the resolution, citing pending litigation.,But the no-confidence vote goes beyond the recent fracas over the campus drag show. Faculty who spoke to the Tribune and requested to remain anonymous out of fear of retaliation say Wendler’s handling of the drag show was the last straw for many of them who feel he has exhibited poor leadership with other issues.,In the resolution, faculty accused Wendler of actively encouraging prospective students to avoid attending a four-year university immediately after high school and encouraging them to attend community college first, which they say has led to enrollment declines.,They point to Wendler’s “Your Community, Your University” tour, in which he visited 66 high schools in the Texas Panhandle, ,According to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, enrollment at the public university in Canyon dropped between fall 2019 and 2022 by nearly 700 students to 9,275 at the start of this academic year.,The resolution also pointed to a spring prospective student event where only 32 potential students registered, calling it a “significant decrease.”,The faculty senate argued Wendler’s actions as president are part of a larger pattern, citing issues at his prior position as chancellor at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, where he was removed for a communication breakdown with university leadership.,Wendler was also criticized at the time for pushing back on the SIU Board’s decision to extend certain medical benefits to the same-sex partners of employees several years before Illinois legalized gay marriage in 2014.

According to faculty senate president Ashley Pinkham, there were 179 votes to condemn Wendler and 82 against it.,Pinkham said in an email to faculty that some colleagues provided comments with their ballots, which will be tabulated and released in the coming days.,The vote is nonbinding and largely symbolic, but faculty hope it sends a message to other university leaders and the Texas A&M University System, which oversees the university.,In a statement, university spokesperson Kelly Carper Polden confirmed the results of the vote. A spokesperson for the Texas A&M University System declined to comment citing pending litigation.,According to Pinkham, 281 ballots were received out of 368 sent to full-time faculty and professional librarians. Twenty ballots were considered invalid because they were submitted incorrectly or received after the Friday deadline. Overall, about 69% of eligible ballots were cast condemning the president.,Wendler drew fire from students and free speech advocates last month when he canceled a student drag show last month arguing that the performances are “derisive, divisive and demoralizing misogyny.”,In a letter to the campus community, Wendler said the shows “stereotype women in cartoon-like extremes for the amusement of others and discriminate against womanhood,” and said allowing the show would be considered workplace prejudice because the shows make fun of women. LGBTQ advocates and students have argued Wendler mischaracterized the art form.,In a resolution announcing the vote of no confidence last week, faculty senate leaders said their concerns were broader and went beyond Wendler’s recent handling of the student drag show. They accused him of abusing his role as president by running the university based on his own religious ideology and said he has exhibited a pattern of “divisive, misogynistic, homophobic and non-inclusive rhetoric that stands in stark contrast with the Core Values of the university.”,They also accused Wendler of presenting his personal opinions and religious beliefs in online blog posts as the official position of the public university.

61,Ruth Simmons will resign early as president of Prairie View A&M University,"Sign up for The Brief,Ruth Simmons, president of the historically Black Prairie View A&M University, said Friday she will resign at the end of February, four months earlier than her expected resignation date, June 1.,The abrupt resignation appears to be over a difference with Texas A&M University System Chancellor John Sharp over hiring during the rest of Simmons’ term as president. In a letter to the campus community Friday, Simmons said she was recently informed that “she could only continue as president with limited presidential authority.”,“My immediate response was that I could not and would not agree to being president in name only,” she stated. “No enduring good can arise from subservience to low standards and expectations.”,Simmons declined further comment through a university spokesperson. ,In a statement, Sharp said that presidents in the Texas A&M System who are leaving cannot hire senior staff or deans except on an interim basis so the new president can choose their team.

63,Can John Sharp protect his maroon empire?,"Sign up for The Brief,Editor's note: This story contains explicit language. ,A few months into the COVID-19 pandemic, John Sharp received a call from someone identifying himself as Ben Carson, then the U.S. secretary of housing and urban development. The caller said he wanted the Texas A&M System chancellor to help set up a trial testing whether a compound from the oleander plant could help combat the new virus.,Sharp didn’t buy it. He figured it was a prank call from Rick Perry, the former Texas governor and then U.S. secretary of energy who was ,“I said, ‘Yea, Perry. You’re full of shit,’” Sharp recounted in an interview with The Texas Tribune as he drove his black pickup truck on a warm day around College Station last year.,But it wasn’t a prank call. Carson was on the other end of the line. Sharp quickly realized his mistake.,“I’m so sorry, Mr. Secretary,” Sharp recalled telling the Trump Cabinet member, with a laugh. “I thought this was Rick Perry screwing with me.”,Then he got down to business.,The evidence was questionable, and the oleander compound wasn’t known to be safe to test on humans to fight the virus. But Carson was convinced. And that put Sharp in a no-win situation: Risk disappointing the head of a federal agency or grant the request and infuriate his faculty by greenlighting a scientifically dubious experiment as a political favor.,Sharp took another route. He quickly used his political connections and donated funds ,Ultimately, ,It's this kind of political maneuvering and eagerness to please that has allowed Sharp, a former state comptroller and a veteran of both houses of the Legislature, to become the longest-serving chancellor in the Texas A&M University System since it was established in 1948. In his 12 years atop the system, which now has a $7.8 billion budget, he has overseen a massive expansion and successfully straddled the chasm between the demands of university faculty and students and conservative state leaders who have increasingly different ideas of how public universities should operate.,He's a master at getting more money from the Legislature. Research spending at the flagship campus at College Station now tops $1 billion, ,Stand next to Sharp for long enough and he’ll rattle off a list of A&M’s accomplishments: the law school is,But lately Sharp’s style of political maneuvering hasn't kept him and the system out of the type of conflicts that are embroiling public universities in Republican-dominated states.,His protégée, former Texas A&M University President Kathy Banks, ,Days later, Sharp came under fire ,Both cases stirred outrage and ,And maybe more importantly — can all that money, growth, and the political wins be considered a success if some on campus say the ,Sharp, 73, blames his stunted political career on an impulsive decision to eat a bunch of crickets.,He recounted the story on a flight to Austin on the system's private jet last year. Over the din of the maroon and white plane's motor, Sharp said he was with Perry and some other college friends on a search for tiny cans of Schlitz beer to liven up a weekend trip, when Perry flashed a middle finger to passing motorcyclists.,The men, whose jackets bore the name of the Bandidos motorcycle gang, parked their bikes and walked toward them, Sharp recounted. He knew they were not to be messed with, especially by a group of drunk college students.,“Perry’s behind me squealing like a pig stuck under a gate,” Sharp recalled. He shouted, “Do something! Do something!”,It was cricket season. So, as Sharp tells the story, he grabbed two handfuls of the insects off the ground and stuffed them in his mouth.,“The cricket juice is running down my face and these guys looked at me and said, ‘Oh you’re too f-ing drunk. Let’s leave,’” Sharp said, admitting he was just as scared as Perry.,Sharp’s college career at Texas A&M, from which he graduated in 1972, was rowdy but productive. He attended an A&M in transition from an all-male, racially segregated school that had ,After college, Sharp followed well-worn grooves into Texas politics, landing a job at the Legislative Budget Board. In 1978, ,In 1986, Sharp was elected to the Texas Railroad Commission, which oversees the state’s oil and gas industry. Then, he served two terms in the 1990s as the state comptroller.,But the political grounds shifted under him. In 1998, Sharp ,Sharp surmised that eating those crickets back in college was the biggest political mistake he’d ever made.,“If I didn't eat those crickets, the [motorcycle gang] would have killed Perry and I would’ve been governor of Texas,” he quipped.,But the antics might have helped him land another job. In 2011, the Perry-appointed A&M System Board of Regents ,They replaced him with Perry’s old cricket-eating dormmate.,When Sharp became chancellor in 2011, Perry was pushing a new vision for Texas higher education ,Momentum for the idea was fading and Sharp wasn’t particularly interested in entering that political maelstrom. He had other plans.,First, he outmaneuvered state leaders skeptical of approving new law schools in the state by ,Next, he initiated a nearly $500 million ,The big ideas kept coming,He added “Texas A&M” to the names of ,Over the past 12 years, Sharp has added 46 faculty who are members of the National Academies — an elite group of distinguished researchers in engineering, medicine and the sciences. And helped to create one of the only programs in the country where students can earn a medical degree and master’s in engineering simultaneously.,Roderic Pettigrew,Pettigrew said he was attracted to A&M not just to teach the first class of “physicianeers,” as A&M calls the EnMed students, but he liked that Sharp took risks and followed through on the idea so quickly.,“He swings for the fences,” Pettigrew said.,Still, Sharp and his maroon empire have failed to shake a long-standing criticism that A&M is not committed enough to boosting student diversity and ,Complaints persist about the low number of Black students ,“I don't think stakeholders like ourselves really mattered to A&M,” Erica Davis Rouse, a 1995 graduate of the university and current president of the ,Sharp has insisted he is committed to solving these problems, but his track record suggests that he hasn’t attacked the problem as aggressively as he has other issues raised by state officials.,When lawmakers in 2015 wanted to allow licensed gun owners to carry guns on public university campuses, ,In a letter to the lieutenant governor, Sharp said that he wasn’t concerned about the bill’s impact on campus safety. After all, Texas A&M is steeped in military tradition.,Instead, he used the opportunity to share his main concern: money. He wrote that “properly funding the higher education of these students is the only issue that counts!”,Two years later, when Hurricane Harvey ravaged the Gulf Coast, Gov. Greg Abbott ,Many involved new funding for or the creation of new centers at Texas A&M.,“When he walks into the Capitol and says, ‘If you give us this money, we're gonna go build this thing for you,’ I think people go, ‘Okay, how much do you want?’” said Nim Kidd, head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, a state agency that coordinates the state’s response to disasters. TDEM joined the Texas A&M System in 2019 after Sharp’s Hurricane Harvey efforts.,Occasionally, his ideas don’t evoke such a positive response. He ,At other times, Sharp’s colorful personality and passion for his alma mater have won him good press.,Once he returned from lunch to the A&M System office with a bunch of parakeets and ,He even decided to ,Before Keen could lead the Aggie crowd in a rendition of “The Road Goes on Forever,” Sharp got down on one knee and popped the question.,Sharp entered this year’s legislative session hoping his relationships would bring another windfall for his schools. The Legislature had a $32.7 billion surplus, and ,But the culture wars kept getting in the way.,The lieutenant governor, angry over some Texas professors’ embrace of critical race theory, ,Christopher Rufo, a hard-right agitator based in Washington state and an architect of the national pushback against perceived left-wing indoctrination in education, had crafted legislation used across the country to dismantle DEI offices in public universities.,Throughout the legislative session, Rufo targeted various public universities in the state, including ,When Abbott ,“No university or agency in the A&M System will admit any student, nor hire any employee based on any factor other than merit,” Sharp said in a directive to university leaders. (This occurred a few months before the ,Sharp took a different approach when it came to tenure, knowing full well that eliminating the long-standing practice would decimate Texas A&M’s ability to recruit top talent. Instead, he proposed that lawmakers adopt Texas A&M’s tenure policies into state law, which he said would codify ways to grant and revoke tenure statewide into law. He also joined the state’s other chancellors in promising to keep tuition flat for the next two years — if lawmakers sent them $1 billion in new funding from the surplus.,But each time Sharp tried to put out a political fire, another one flared up.,The swift suspension of Alonzo came after the lieutenant governor said he’d heard that the A&M pharmacology professor had bashed him in a lecture. The university, in the midst of pitching lawmakers why they should send the system billions in additional funding, placed her on leave within hours of Patrick’s call. Sharp told Patrick she could be fired, pending an investigation.,When the flagship campus recruited McElroy, the UT professor, who used to work at The New York Times, to run its revamped journalism school, governor-appointed regents were furious.,“We were going to start a journalism department to get high-quality conservative Aggie students into the journalism world to help direct our message,” ,After the Tribune uncovered both stories, an uproar commenced. Faculty rang alarms about threats to academic freedom. Department leaders questioned how they could recruit new talent. Both incidents sparked national news.,The brouhaha — especially the botched hiring of McElroy, a Black woman — renewed skepticism about Sharp's commitment or ability to protect A&M from political interference.,Students and alumni recalled Sharp’s refusal to remove the Sul Ross statue. In an interview last summer, Sharp argued that removing it would fray strong ties with the vocal Texas A&M alumni base.,“That statue was never coming down,” Sharp said. “It would have done a lot more harm and made things way unworkable with the upsetting of the former students.”,Instead, Sharp and the Board of Regents ,Sharp said it will take more time to see the impact of that scholarship program. Preliminary data for this fall does show slight progress. Black student enrollment is at 2,643, a 10% increase over the prior year, though still hovering around 3.4% of the total student population, according to data provided by the university. Meanwhile, white students make up 50% of the total student enrollment, while Hispanic students account for nearly 23%.,Students of color say it will take more than just reaching out to make them feel their school is a welcoming place. As state leaders railed against diversity, equity and inclusion efforts on college campuses this year, they wanted Sharp to defend those initiatives the same way he defended tenure.,“There has to be some point at which you can make a stand against it,” Nicolas Le, a Texas A&M sophomore who is of Mexican and Vietnamese heritage, told the Tribune. “I know that the money does come from them, but I feel like there has to be some standards. There has to be some morals.”,But even as some professors and alumni expressed outrage, few seemed to want Sharp to leave.,“If it's not Sharp, then who would it be?” asked Rouse, the president of the Black Former Student Network. “Because we could go further backwards than we already are.”,If Sharp has his way, he’ll have at least five more years to cement his legacy in the A&M System. In 2021, the ,That’s because he still has goals left to achieve. He wants to improve Texas A&M’s medical school, and grow the RELLIS research campus to the status of a national laboratory. And he's proven he can still adeptly maneuver the halls of the Texas Capitol when necessary.,But distrust in Texas A&M leadership persists. The Faculty Senate is still conducting its own investigations into what happened with McElroy’s hiring and the suspension of Alonzo, the professor who allegedly criticized Patrick during a talk on the opioid epidemic. Faculty leaders have been critical of Sharp at times during the controversies, but have also said they appreciate his instinct to engage with all parties.,“Given what he's been facing, and how difficult the various contrary positions are right now, he's been doing a really good job trying to navigate all sides of the aisle,” Tracy Hammond, president of the Texas A&M Faculty Senate, said.,A few weeks after Banks — who, months earlier, Sharp was calling the best president in A&M history — was forced out, ,The report included a letter from Sharp to the Aggie community calling for unity.,“It is time to come together, put our house back in order, and vow to never let this happen again,” he wrote. “We all must rededicate ourselves to the Aggie values that define us and bind us.”,Sharp apologized for the treatment of McElroy, but defended his handling of the case involving Alonzo.
