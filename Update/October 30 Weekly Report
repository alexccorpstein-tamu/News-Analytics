James Nieberding
Created a cosine similiarity function to check if new articles don't relate to the previous group of articles
This can be used to identify outliners as well if enough don't relate we can look into if there is another topic in the corpus which means we'd have to update hyperparameters
Expanded the feature vectors in gradient boosting algorithm
